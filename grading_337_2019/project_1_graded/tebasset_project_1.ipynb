    "A prime number is simply defined as any number greater than one that has divisors other than itself and one. Due to this property which differentiates them, prime numbers are often utilized in data security and encryption protocols. False primes, which are definitionally not prime numbers, represent another unique catagory of numbers in that they share some important characteristics of true primes numbers, such as congruene. For the purpose of this project, congruency will be defined as follows:"

What this means is that the mod of $a^P$ is going to be equivalent to $a(modP)$ for all values of a from 1 up to that value P. If this is the case, the P value is either a prime number or has Prime like properties. A differentiation between prime or prime like can then be made using a prime number test, in which those found to be non-prime numbers are then assumed to be prime like, and therefor a false prime. "

False primes are relatively few and far inbetween, as suggested by the first false prime appearing at P = 561. Because of this, false prime 20 can be assumed to be a very high number, making it necessary to take into account computational efficiency when creating a solution. The general approach to solving this problem will be as follows: make a function identiying primes; make a function identifying if a number is prime like; combining the functions into a singular function to calculate the first 20 prime numbers; making a function to calculate the primary decomposition of a number; using that primary decomposition function on the 20 prime numbers calculated."

    "When simply looking at the first 20 false primes and there primary decompositions, the first thing that I noticed was that all of the false primes were odd numbers, which to me was unexpected. As false primes are non-prime numbers that mirror some properties of prime numbers, I was expecting some of the tabulated numbers to be even. Likewise, when looking at the primary decomposition of the 20 calculated numbers, none of them have 2 as a factor, which is one of the requirnments for having an even number. Another very odd occurance that was observable in this calculated group of false primes was the numbers distribution along a standard integer numberline. For example, if you were to look at the seporation between false prime 10 and false prime 11, you would see a seporation of 11,700. Looking at the seporation for the next group, false prime 11 and false prime 12, you get a seporation of 5,616. For 12 and 13, that seporation becomes 5,976. This is particularly odd in that it doesn't emediatly appear to follow any form of standard growth model, such as linear or exponential, as per my expectations. A final interesting occurance that I noticed in the primary distrubution of the false primes was that the highest prime factors, allong with the lowest prime factors, did not seem to follow any noticable patterns in terms of there distributions amoung the 20 false primes. One trend that was apparent, and expected, is that as the value of the false prime increases, both the number of factors and the magnitude of the factors tended to increase. A final trend that can be observed in the primary decomposition of the false primes is that no two numbers are repeated in the decomposition, which is a bit strange. Many odd numbers, such as 49, have a decomposition that involves doubles odd numbers, producing another odd number. This does not seem to occur here, atleast within this small sample size. Based off of these findings, it might be concluded that the seemingly random nature of these numbers, lacking apparent connectivity, it was makes them so unique and applicable to add aplications."

    "In terms of overall computational intensity, the the helper function *isPrimeLike* was among the most computationally expensive components of the solutions. Fortunatley, the way the solution was implemented decreased the overall number of calls for that function, decreasing the burden that function had on the run time. Specifically, this solution nested the if statements in *isPrimeLike* so that it was called on functions that met the other requirnments for being a false prime, in this case returning false for *isPrime*. A second thrick that was used to increase the overall efficiency of the *findFalsePrimes* solution function was to utilize the math function Pow() as opposed to using the remained function %. Due to the way both functions are designed, using Pow() multiple times is less computationally expensive than the alternative in this case. A final thing that was implemented to reduce the algorithms computational complexity was starting the integer search at *n = 562* as opposed to 2, as the instructions clearly specified that 561 was the first false prime. In doing so, we reduced unnecessary computations for numbers below 562, whose membership to the false prime number set was already established. "

    "In calculating the primary decomposition values for the first 20 false primes, we were able to get some insight into the patterns present within these sparsely populated numbers. Of the primary findings was that there was no obvious patterns connecting the false primes to eachother, besides the fact that they each satisfied the prime like requirements as detailed in the introduction. The uneven spacing between the calculated numbers was what emediatley alterted me to the oddities associated with this set. This is one potential reason that cryptographers are so reliant on said numbers. "

    "Of the major take aways from completing this fuction is that false primes are very sparsely populated amoung any calculated list of prime numbers using a less direct version of prime number detection. Given the extremely specific set of characteristics that a false prime needs to meet in order to actually be a false prime, it is not surprising how uncommon they actually are. This, unfortunately, ties into the fact that identifying false primes is extremely computationally expensive, as hinted at by the roughly 2:30 second run time assoiated with simpley returning the first 20 false primes on a standard number line. According to Carl Pomerance, it would cost as much as 10 million dollars to complete the required factorization to positively identify a 144 digit false prime in 1988 when the calculation was completed, and that cost scales 100 billion for a 200 digit number [1]. While it must be noted that those quoted numbers have decreased since the turn of the century, the cost is still in many cases prohibitive. This has had effects on the feilds of key-cryptography, which heavily utilizes false prime numbers."
