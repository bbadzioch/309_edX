    "In our mathematical number system we split up whole numbers greater than one into 2 categories, primes and non-primes. Prime numbers are any numbers that only have 2 divisors being that of one and itself. Some examples of prime numbers are 2,3,5,7,11,13 and many many more. Non-primes are kind of self explanatory. They are numbers that have more than 2 divisors whether it is 3, 7, or even 1000 doesnt matter they would all be non-primes\n",

The basis of being a prime number is that you can not divide that said number by any number besides itself or zero. f you were able to divide it and do the primary decomposition that number would not be a prime."

    "False primes are a very weird situation mathematics. You can figure out which number is a false primes by doing two tests on the number. The first is to test if the number is not a prime. This is very simply done by just seeing if there is a number that can divide it other than one and itself. The second is the fermat primality test. This test is to see and figure out if a number is prime-like. most of the time if it passes the number is a prime but there are very rare scenarios where it does not pass and we call these numbers a false prime. some of these numbers include 91, 121, 341, and 561.\n"
