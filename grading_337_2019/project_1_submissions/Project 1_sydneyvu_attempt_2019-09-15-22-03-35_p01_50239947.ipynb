    "In this project, we used our knowledge of prime numbers to create a list of false primes. We created a function that found numbers that were prime like but were *not* prime. This function allowed us to create a list of the first 20 false primes and then find their primary decompositions. A numbers primary decomposition is the most basic makeup of that number and can be used to analyze the number more in-depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make more accurate assumptions, we would need to continue our list further. But, based on what we found, it can be predicted that as the list goes on, every prime number will be used in at least one primary decomposition. As the prime numbers get larger, numbers other than 7 and 13 will become more prominent.\n",
    "More observations are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 7 and 13 were in 50% of the primary decompositions we found\n",
    "* 7 and 13 were in the same decomposition 25% of the time\n",
    "* Ten of the primary numbers found were unique, and not found in more than one of the found decompositions\n",
    "* Each primary number, up until 43, was used at least once\n",
    "* Smaller prime numbers were found to be used in more than one decomposition\n",
    "* Larger prime numbers were more likely to only be found in one decomposition"
