    "A theorem has been proposed that attempts to describe prime numbers through a modulus equivalency (referred to in this report as *Prime Modulus Theorem*). This theorem is described below. It appears, however, that this theorem does not always give an accurate result when used to determine all prime numbers. There are purpoted to be some numbers which satisfy the *Prime Modulus Theorem* but which are not truly prime numbers. This set of numbers will be called 'false primes,' as the *Prime Modulus Theorem* wrongly reports them to be prime. \n",

    "**Theorem:** \n",
    "If the remainder of $\\frac{a^p}{p}$ is equal to the remainder of $\\frac{a}{p}$, for all numbers $0<a<p$, then $p$ is prime.\n",
    "$$\\frac {a^p}{p}=\\frac{a}{p} \\quad (mod p) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, the *Prime Modulus Theorem* and its exceptions will be investigated. Specifically, the results of this report detail the primary decomposition of the first twenty false primes.  The primary decomposition of a number, n, is a set of prime factors of $n$ which multiply to equal $n$. For example, the factors of $12$ include $[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]$. The prime factors of $12$ are a subset of this: $[2,3]$. The primary decomposition of $12$ is $[2,2,3]$, because $2*2=4 4*3=12$. The primary decomposition can be used to determine some important properties of numbers. The conclusion section of this report describes some of the properties of false primes that can be determined by analysis of their primary decompositions. "

    "This report has shown that there are indeed numbers which satisfy the *Prime Modulus Theorem* but are not actually prime numbers. The first twenty examples of these false prime numbers displayed above give a sample set which can be used to determine several properties of false primes. It seems noteworthy that there are no examples of even false primes, so the number 2 never appears as a member of the set of numbers comprising the primary decomposition of the first twenty false primes. False primes also do not seem to have factors which are the squares of other prime numbers, since each prime factor in the primary decomposition set is only listed once. Finally, though prime factors in the primary decompositions of the first twenty false primes contain prime numbers between 3 and 233, 43 never appears, making it the only prime number less than 50 to not be a member of the primary decomposition sets of the first twenty false primes. \n",

    "It can also be seen that the distance from one false prime to the next increases progressively throughout the set, with the difference between the second and the first false primes being 544, and the distance between the 20th and the 19th false primes being 36,184. The fact that the first prime number is 561 and that the distance between each successive false prime grows bigger implies that the *Prime Modulus Theorem* is a decent approximation of prime numbers for a good proportion of prime numbers and a perfect theorem when working with small numbers below 561. Beyond 561, this theorem is bad for awhile as every few hundred numbers provides a false prime, but it improves again, though is no longer perfect, as larger numbers are assessed since the space between false primes increases.
