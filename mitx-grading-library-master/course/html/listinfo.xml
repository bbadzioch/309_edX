<html display_name="ListGrader">

<p>Whenever there is more than one input to a logical problem unit, you will need to use a <code>ListGrader</code> to combine the inputs. ListGraders allow you to have items that are ordered/unordered and in groups. You can even nest ListGraders to construct problems that are very simple on pen and paper, but until now have been basically impossible in edX.</p>
