<problem display_name="Factorial Function" showanswer="always" weight="10" attempts="">

  <p>We have significantly expanded the sampling capabilities of our grader compared to edX. For example, we can sample integers, allowing us to use the factorial function. Here is an example.</p>

  <p>What is the Taylor series expansion of \(\exp(x)\) about \(x = 0\)? (Answer: <code>x^n/fact(n)</code>). Try typing <code>fact(n-1)</code> to see what happens in that case, too.</p>

<script type="text/python" system_path="python_lib">
from mitxgraders import *
grader = FormulaGrader(
    answers='x^n/fact(n)',
    variables=['x', 'n'],
    sample_from={
        'x': RealInterval(),
        'n': IntegerRange([3, 8])
    }
)
</script>

<p style="display:inline">[mathjaxinline]e^x = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty[/mathjaxinline] </p>
<customresponse cfn="grader" inline="1">
  <textline math="1" inline="1" correct_answer="x^n/fact(n)" preprocessorClassName="MJxPrep" preprocessorSrc="/static/MJxPrep.js"/>
</customresponse>

<p>Update: we now use the gamma function to compute factorials, so expressions like <code>fact(1.5)</code> will be accepted!</p>

<p>When using textline input (as in the above example), the math preview doesn't natively recognize fact() as a function. This affects a number of other functions too, including a number of standard edX functions. We've developed a series of renderer definitions as a javascript library to teach the renderer how to make it look pretty. These definitions are loaded through the MathJax preprocessor in the textline tag. See the documentation for details.</p>
