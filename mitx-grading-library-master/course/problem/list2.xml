<problem display_name="Embedded Lists" showanswer="always" weight="10" attempts="">

  <p>It's possible to have a SingleListGrader inside a ListGrader. Separate the numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive into even and odd numbers. Put the odd numbers in one box, and the even numbers in the other. Order is unimportant.</p>

<script type="text/python" system_path="python_lib">
from mitxgraders import *
grader = ListGrader(
    answers=[
        ['2', '4', '6', '8', '10'],
        ['1', '3', '5', '7', '9']
    ],
    subgraders=SingleListGrader(
        subgrader=NumericalGrader()
    )
)
</script>

<customresponse cfn="grader" inline="1">
  <textline math="1" inline="1" correct_answer="2,4,6,8,10"/>
  <br/>
  <textline math="1" inline="1" correct_answer="1,3,5,7,9"/>
</customresponse>
