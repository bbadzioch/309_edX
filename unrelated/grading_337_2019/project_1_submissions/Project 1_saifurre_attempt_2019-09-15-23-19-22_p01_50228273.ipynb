    "Since elementry school, we have learned about Prime and composite numbers. What is a prime number? A prime number is a number in it is only divisible by 1 and the number itself, which is what makes the number special. In elementry school, we have discussed Prime numbers and even found some. For example, 3,5,7,11,13 are all examples of prime numbers. However, we did not really test for bigger Prime numbers. For example, what is the biggest Prime number after 1000. Next, we will come across some numbers that act like Prime numbers but are not actually prime. We will find those numbers using the congruence test which will showcase numbers that act like Prime but are actually composite. We are going to prove those numbers are composite using decomposition.
