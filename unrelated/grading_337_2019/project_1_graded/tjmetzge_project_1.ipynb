    "#### A prime number is a number greater than 1, but it is only divisable by 1 and itself. One key property that relates to prime numbers is congruency. The Therom states if $p$ is prime, then $a^p\\equiv a (mod p)$ for any integer $0 < a < p$. What we are trying to find are false primes, which pass the congruency test but are not prime numbers. Our first goal was to find the first 20 false primes. The next step was to find the primary decomposition of each false prime. It is a fact that any integer $n > 1$ can be written as multiple prime numbers multiplied by eachother. These numbers are considered the primary decomposition of the integer, which is what we are trying to find for each of the 20 false primes. Finally, I will have some final thoughts on flase primes and their properties at the end."

    "   **One main thing that I noticecd was that every integer is based off of these prime numbers, shown in the primary decomposition. Every integer is made up of prime numbers multiplied by eachother. False primes are in between prime numbers and composite numbers(opposite of prime). While they pass the congruency test that was previously noted, they are not prime numbers because their primary decomposition is made up of at least 3 prime numbers. Actual prime number's have a primary decomposition with only two numbers, `1` and itself. Prime numbers also seem to be very rare, with the first 20 being 160,000 numbers apart.**"

What I did was use a built in function `pow` as stated earlier and it cut down the runtime for the function to about 10 seconds. Overall I was able to find the first twenty false primes and the decomposition for each of these numbers and work through the code to make it run fluintley.**"
