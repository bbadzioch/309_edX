A _false-prime_ is _prime-like_, yet it is _not_ prime. Herein, the first 20 prime-like numbers will be reported and their primary decomposition will be determined.

If _only_ prime numbers followed theorem 1, then this would represent a novel way to identify prime numbers. However, since there exists _false-prime_ numbers, using theorem 1 alone would not produce a list of just prime numbers. Thus, the first 20 _false-prime_ numbers and their primary decomposition were explored in this project. \n",

    "One property of a _false-prime_ is that it must be able to be written as a primary decomposition. For each of the 20 prime numbers that are listed above, each of them are able to be written as being made up of only prime numbers. The 20 false primes, which must satisfy the rule that they are not prime themselves, can be written as the decomposition of prime numbers. That seems counterintuitive. The importance of this property and its practical applications are not completely known to me.\n",
