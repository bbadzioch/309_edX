    "Prime numbers are used in many fields and technologies. They have unique properties which make them useful when storing data and to secure information. This is specifically due to these numbers not having any factors except themselves and one. Prime numbers have many different occurrences throughout mathematics including abstract algebra, number theory, and computer science. Prime numbers are also found in nature. A cicadaâ€™s lifecycle is based on prime numbers since they emerge every 7,13, or 17 years. Similarly, they are used in the arts, famous paintings often use prime numbers for structuring since they are appealing to the eye.   \n"
