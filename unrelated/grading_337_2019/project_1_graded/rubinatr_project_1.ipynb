    "The first false prime is 516 and the twentieth is 162401. This was found using a code for if a number is not prime and is prime-like within a range from 2 through 170,000. As for the primary decompositions, there is a trend happening with them. The number two never appears in any of these primary decompositions and there is not number that is repeated in any of the decompositions. All of these numbers in the twenty primary decompositions are all smaller primary numbers. The smallest primary decomposition number is 241, but compared to 160,000 that's relatively small. "
