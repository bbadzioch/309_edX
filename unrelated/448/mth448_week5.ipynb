PARKED THE CAR, CAME BACK TO GO BACK HOME AND THE KEY &#128273; IN THE IGNITION WOULD NOT TURN. IT WAS LOCKED OR JAMMED, DON\\x92T KNOW. KEY WOULD NOT TURN IN THE IGNITION SWITCH TO TURN THE CAR ON!!! I WENT TO THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FROM GENERAL MOTORS ON MY 2009 CHEVY COBALT. I FOUND A NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID# 14V171000 THAT SHOWS THE RECALL FOR MY CAR. IT DESCRIBES AN IGNITION SWITCH RECALL. I CALLED THE CHUCK NASH CHEVROLET WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD REPAIRED THE RECALL. APPARENTLY THEY REPAIRED IT WITH A DEFECTIVE IGNITION-SWITCH OR NOT AT ALL. THE RECALL STATES THAT SOME VEHICLES WERE REPAIRED WITH DEFECTIVE OR USED PARTS. MARY BARRA, GENERAL MOTORS CEO STATED THAT ALL AFFECTED RECALL VEHICLES WOULD BE REPAIRED UP TO CUSTOMER SAFETY STANDARDS. I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP IN THIS MATTER.

THE BATTERY VENT TUBE IS CONNECTED TO THE TOP OF THE BATTERY BY A PLASTIC ELBOW, A PLASTIC VENT TUBE IS CONNECTED TO THE MALE NIPPLE ON THE ELBOW. THE PLASTIC VENT TUBE INSIDE DIAMETER APPEARS TO BE TOO SMALL INSIDE DIAMETER FOR THE MALE NIPPLE.  THE PLASTIC VENT TUBE IS SPLIT WHERE IT ATTACHES TO MY BATTERY WHERE IT IS PUSHED ONTO THE MALE NIPPLE WHICH WILL ALLOW THE VENTED HYDROGEN GAS TO VENT INTO THE TRUNK (WHICH IS PART OF THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT ONLY SEPARATED BY THE BACK SEAT)  I THINK PRESENTS A POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARD AND POTENTIAL FIRE RISK.

THE  FRONT WHEELS IMMEDIATELY LOCKED UP AND MY CAR ROTATED 90 DEGREES COUNTERCLOCKWISE WITHOUT SLOWING DOWN AT ALL.  FORTUNATELY, THE DRIVER OF THE VAN REALIZED THAT HE HAD SCREWED UP AND GOT THROUGH THE INTERSECTION RAPIDLY AND A COLLISION WAS AVOIDED. THEN LAST NIGHT, OCT. 16TH, AGAIN IN THE RAIN, I TRIED TO STOP AT A YELLOW LIGHT ON A SLIGHT DOWNHILL GRADE FROM ABOUT 45 MPH.  AGAIN THE WHEELS LOCKED UP AND THE CAR SKIDDED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION AT ABOUT 40 MPH.\\r\\n\\r\\nI HAVE BEEN DRIVING SINCE 1973 AND HAVE LOGGED OVER A MILLION MILES.  THESE FUZION TOURING TIRES ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS TIRES I HAVE EVER DRIVEN ON, ESPECIALLY ON WET PAVEMENT.  I HAVE HAD OTHER TIRES ON MY COBALT AND NEVER HAD ANY SIMILAR INCIDENTS.  I AM REPLACING THEM TOMORROW BECAUSE MY LIFE IS WORTH MORE TO ME THAN THE $400 THAT A SET OF TIRES COSTS.  DRIVING IN THE RAIN WITH THOSE TIRES IS LIKE DRIVING ON ICE WITH NORMAL TIRES.  THESE TIRES ARE POTENTIALLY DEADLY AND I THINK THEY SHOULD BE RECALLED IMMEDIATELY AND THEN SHREDDED. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THAT THERE ARE NO TRACTION, TREADWEAR, OR TEMPERATURE RATINGS ON THESE TIRES.  THE SIZE IS195/60-15, 88H.  I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS THAT THESE ARE FUZION TOURING TIRES, NOT FUZION HRI.  I HAD A SET OF FUZION HRI'S AND THEY WERE FINE.  *TR\",\n",

WITH THE ENGINE OFF, THE KEY WAS STILL STUCK IN THE CAR AND ALL THAT WAS NEEDED TO RE-START THE CAR WAS A GIGGLE OF THE KEY. THIS IS REALLY UNSAFE. WITH MY KEY STUCK IN MY CAR, I WAS UNABLE TO LOCK THE CAR DOOR; OTHERWISE I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REENTER THE CAR. THIS MEANT THAT A CHILD COULD HAVE ENTERED MY CAR AND WITH THE KEY ALREADY IN THE CAR (SINCE IT WAS STUCK) THEY COULD HAVE DRIVEN IT AND CAUSED SERIOUS BODILY INJURY OR DEATH TO THEMSELVES OR TO ANOTHER.  IF MY CAR WOULD HAVE BEEN AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION, THEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WAY TO SHUT IT OFF EXCEPT FOR RUNNING IT OUT OF GAS. THIS COULD POSE A SERIOUS SAFETY RISK IN SEVERAL SITUATIONS SUCH AS A CAR BEING TRAPPED IN A GARAGE WITH LITTLE VENTILATION OR IF IT WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT INVOLVING LEAKING GASOLINE. GENERAL MOTORS IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND HAVE EVEN ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN ON THE MATTER (DOCUMENT ID: 2552146 ;  #10256: CUSTOMER SATISFACTION - IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER - REPLACE IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER - (DEC. 14, 2010).

I HAD TO MISS WORK & CALLED THE DEALERSHIP & INFORMED THE MECHANIC OF THE PROBLEM. HE ASKED ME TO DRIVE IT IN. I INFORMED HIM THAT I DIDN'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING ON THE STREETS OR THE HIGHWAY. THE MECHANIC OFFERED FOR ME TO USE THEIR TOWING COMPANY BUT THEY CHARGE. I INFORMED THEM THAT I HAVE TOWING SERVICE. THE CAR WAS TOWED THAT DAY & ON FRIDAY, I RECEIVED A CALL; WHILE I WAS AT WORK FROM THE MECHANIC STATING THAT THEY CHECKED THE CAR OUT & THE FRONT THROTTLE BODY HAD TO BE REPLACED DUE TO A SENSOR BEING FAULTY. THE COST OF REPAIRS WOULD BE $575. I JUST PURCHASED THIS CAR ON 4/19/14 FROM JIM TRENARY IN O'FALLON MO & 3 WEEKS LATER, I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL FAILING.  THE DEALERSHIP DID PAY FOR THAT EXPENSE BUT NOT THIS ONE BECAUSE THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEM ISN'T COVERED UNDER THE POWER TRAIN WARRANTY. I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO GET OVER ON ME BECAUSE I AM A WOMAN & DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT CARS. I CALLED TO SEE IF THEY COULD TRY TO FIX IT FOR LESS BUT WAS INFORMED THAT THE THROTTLE BODY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED IN ORDER FOR THE SENSOR TO BE PUT IN. I HAVE TO STILL PAY THE NOTE EVERY MONTH ON A VEHICLE THAT WAS ASSURED AT THE TIME OF THE SALE WAS SAFE & WOULD HAVE ANY PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT WAS TAKEN CARE OF INCLUDING THE REPLACEMENT OF THE POWER SWITCH IGNITION. I SENT A TEXT TO MY SALESMAN ASKING TO BE PUT IN ANOTHER VEHICLE BUT TO MY DISMAY, HE INFORMED ME THAT I CAN'T TRADE OUT OF MY VEHICLE FOR 18-24 MONTHS. I FEEL LIKE I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY THE $575 & THE MECHANIC IS TRYING TO GET OVER BECAUSE I AM A WOMAN. I INFORMED THE MECHANIC THAT I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THE $575 BECAUSE I DON'T MAKE THAT MUCH & HAVE OTHER BILLS TO TAKE CARE OF. I BOUGHT THAT CAR FOR RELIABILITY.  *TR\",\n",

THE BRAKES WERE SUDDENLY VERY STIFF. I DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE WORKING. I WAS IN THE LEFT LANE WHEN THIS OCCURRED AND IMMEDIATELY PUT ON MY EMERGENCY LIGHTS AND TRIED TO MOVE TO THE MIDDLE LANE, TO THE RIGHT LANE SO I COULD GO TO THE SHOULDER. WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO SWITCH THE LANES, THE POWER STEERING WASN'T WORKING. I MANAGED TO MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL SLIGHTLY SO THAT I COULD SWITCH LANES. THERE WAS ONCOMING TRAFFIC BEFORE AN AVAILABLE SHOULDER SO I TRIED TO SPEED UP. I WAS UNABLE TO INCREASE MY SPEED. I WAS ABLE TO SLOW DOWN NATURALLY BUT I WASN'T ABLE TO COMPLETELY STOP UNTIL I GOT TO THE SHOULDER AND PUSHED EXTREMELY HARD ON THE BREAKS AND HELD DOWN ON THE BREAK FOR SEVERAL SECONDS. THE RADIO WAS STILL WORKING AND THE HEATER WAS BLOWING COLD AIR. I WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE WORKING AGAIN BY TURNING THE IGNITION TO THE OFF POSITION AND TURNING THE IGNITION BACK ON. I THINK MY VEHICLE'S ENGINE TURNED OFF WHILE I WAS DRIVING. I HAVE ONSTAR ON THE VEHICLE AND IMMEDIATELY PUSHED THE BUTTON WHEN I WAS UNABLE TO BREAK PROPERLY WITH MY VEHICLE. THE LADY I SPOKE WITH SAID THAT SHE WAS SEEING SOME PROBLEM WITH MY BREAKS BUT I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP THE SAME DAY AND THEY FOUND NO CODES FOR MY VEHICLE. THE NEXT DAY THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THEY FIXED THE IGNITION RECALL ON MY VEHICLE AND THAT MIGHT HAVE FIXED THE ISSUE.  ON TWO OTHER OCCASIONS BEFORE THE RECALL WAS ANNOUNCED, I HAD A SIMILAR ISSUE AND BROUGHT IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG.

       "   'Summary': \"THE MORNING AFTER COMING BACK FROM A TRIP I WENT DOWN TO GET IN MY COLBALT AND FOUND MY LEFT FRONT TIRE FLAT.  I GOT MY MANUAL OUT TO READ HOW TO CHANGE THE TIRE AND CHANGED IT.  WE NOTICED THE SIZE DIFFERENCE IN THE TIRES RIGHT AWAY, REGULAR TIRE IS P205/55R16 H, THE SPARE IS A T115/70D15 M. THESE ARE THE ORIGINAL TIRES THAT CHEVROLET PUT ON THE CAR. THE MANUAL SAID WE COULD GO NORMAL SPEED.  I DROVE A BLOCK TO GET THE TIRE FIXED AND TURNED AROUND AND WENT BACK HOME.  THE CAR DIPPED HORRIBLE AND DRAGGED WHEN I PULLED BACK INTO MY DRIVE WAY. IT ALSO MADE RUBBING SOUNDS. IT DID NOT FILL SAFE TO DRIVE.  WE TOOK THE TIRE IN AND HAD IT FIXED WITHOUT THE CAR, BROUGHT IT HOME AND PUT IT BACK ON CAR. I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH CHEVROLET SINCE THEN TO SEE IF IT WAS AN ERROR ON THE SPARE.  THEY HAVE TOLD ME THAT IT IS THE RIGHT SPARE, ALTHOUGH A COUPLE OF THE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE TALKED TO THOUGHT IT WAS BAD TO HAVE A 15 INCH SPARE WITH 16 INCH TIRES.  THEY ALSO TOLD ME THAT WHAT I NEED TO DO IS IF THE FLAT IS ON THE FRONT I'M SUPPOSE TO CHANGE TWO TIRES.  THEY TOLD ME TO PUT A BACK TIRE ON THE FRONT AND THE SPARE ON THE BACK, WHICH IS NOT THE DIRECTION IN THE MANUAL.  THEY TOLD ME I CAN GO 50 MPH AND GET THE TIRE FIXED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO NOW OUT ON A BUSY HIGHWAY THEY WANT ME TO CHANGE TWO TIRES AND HAVE THE BACK OF MY CAR DIP HORRIBLY.  I FEEL THIS SPARE IS UNSAFE BECAUSE IT IS SMALLER THEN THE TIRES IT IS REPLACING. IT MAKES THE CAR TILT SO YOU CAN'T DRIVE AT SAFE SPEEDS NOT TO SAY THE DAMAGE YOU CAN DO TO YOUR CAR. I LEAVE IN A RURAL AREA AND SOME OF THE ROADS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SHOULDER TO CHANGE ONE SPARE LET ALONE TWO.\",\n",

I TOOK THE REPAIR BILL TO GANLEY CHEVROLET DEALER LOCATED AT 13865 BROOKPARK RD, BROOKPARK OH 44142. MAN IN SERVICE DEPARTMENT CHECKED WITH HIS SUPERVISOR ABOUT REIMBURSEMENT THEN GAVE ME FORM TO FILL OUT TO SEND TO GMAC FOR REIMBURSEMENT. I CONTACTED GMC TO VERIFY THE CORRECT MAILING ADDRESS AND MAILED THE FORM TO THEM ON AUGUST 6TH THEY SAID I SHOULD GET THE REIMBURSEMENT. I DIDN'T HEAR BACK SO I CALLED THEM ON OCT 15TH. THEY WANTED ME TO FAX PAPERWORK AND REGISTRATION TO THEM AND SAID REIMBURSEMENT WOULD BE FORTHCOMING. I FAXED THE PAPERWORK TO THEM ON OCTOBER 18TH.  I RECEIVED A CALL ON OCTOBER 25TH AND WAS TOLD NO REIMBURSEMENT. MY CAR HAD LESS THAN 38,000 MILES ON IT AT THE TIME OF THE REPAIR, MECHANIC SAID LINES ON FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY WERE DRY ROTTED AND THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED. HE HAD TO DROP THE TANK AND REPLACE THE LINES AND THE FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY. COST FOR THE REPAIR WAS $486.00. GMAC REFUSED TO REIMBURSE ME FOR THE REPAIRS. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE BBB AND THEY REFERRED ME TO THE STATE SECRETARY, I CONTACTED RUTH JOHNSON, SECRETARY OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN PER BBB INSTRUCTIONS. I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HER THAT I SHOULD CONTACT YOU. THERE WAS A RECALL ON THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM WITH THE CAR BUT PER GMAC IT IS NO LONGER VALID. CAN YOU HELP?\\r\\n\",\n",

HOW CAN THIS BE ALLOWED,FIXED IN ONE STATE FREE OF CHARGE BY GM AND NOT FIXED AT ALL IN ANOTHER. A FUEL PROBLEM OR A LEAK OF ANT KIND SHOULD BE A CONCERN FOR GM AND IS A MAJOR ISSUE.I'M LOCATED IN PENNSYLVANIA BUT MY VIN SAYS I DON'T QUALIFY FOR THIS RECALL OFFERED ELSEWHERE,SO SHOULD  I HAVE TO FOOT A REPAIR BILL FOR AN ISSUE THAT GM MOST DEFINITELY KNOWS ABOUT. I'M CONFUSED, THE PROBLEM IS THE SAME AS BEING DESCRIBED ON THE RECALL FOR THE OTHER AREAS YET I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY BECAUSE THIS RECALL IS NOT IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE RECALL SHOULD BE FOR ALL AFFECTED VEHICLES NOT JUST SOME OF THEM AND FREE OF CHARGE  .I RELAYED INFO TO A GM REP ON 9/10 /18 IN THE EVENING AND ALL SHE COULD DO WAS APOLIGIZE AND THEN TELL ME THAT IT DEPENDED ON WHICH MANUFACTURING PLANT MADE THE VEHICLE. WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH IT STUMPS ME I TOLD HER THAT IS SHODDY AND SUB STANDARD  WORK SHOULD BE REPAIRED AT GENERAL MOTORS EXPENSE NOT HARD WORKING PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE AN EXTRA $1000 OR SO SITTING AROUND TO SHELL OUT.

       "   'Summary': \"WE HAVE OWNED A 2009 CHEVY COBALT FOR 3 YEARS - AND EACH YEAR, SOMETHING HAS HAD TO BE REPLACED/REPAIRED WITH THE FUEL SYSTEM. THE FIRST YEAR, THE FUEL PUMP HAD TO BE REPLACED AND WAS PAID FOR OUT OF POCKET. THE SECOND YEAR, THE FUEL PUMP HAD TO BE REPLACED AGAIN AND WAS COVERED UNDER A RECALL. ONCE AGAIN, THE CAR IS ACTING THE SAME AS BEFORE EACH TIME THE FUEL PUMP HAD TO BE REPLACED (STRONG GAS ODOR, LEAKING FUEL, DECREASED POWER WHEN TURNING ESPECIALLY, AS IF SUFFICIENT FUEL ISN'T BEING SUPPLIED TO THE MOTOR) FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW. \\r\\n\\r\\nI CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURER TO REPORT THE REPEAT CONCERNS (CASE # 9-4957891748) AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE IS A SPECIAL COVERAGE ADJUSTMENT (#12191) AVAILABLE FOR A FUEL PUMP MODULE REPLACEMENT THAT OUR CAR MAY QUALIFY FOR AND WAS DIRECTED TO TAKE IT TO ANY GM DEALERSHIP FOR A DIAGNOSTIC REVIEW WHICH I DID THE SAME DAY. I JUST RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP AND BASED ON THEIR DIAGNOSTIC REVIEW, THE PROBLEM THIS TIME IS DUE TO THE FUEL LINES RUSTING OUT, WHICH WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER THE SPECIAL COVERAGE ADJUSTMENT. THERE ARE ONLY 121,000 MILES ON OUR VEHICLE AND IT IS KEPT IN A GARAGE WHEN NOT BEING DRIVEN. NEEDING TO REPLACE THE FUEL LINES NOW AFTER HAVING TO HAVE THE FUEL PUMP REPLACED TWICE (AND ALL WITHIN 3 YEARS) SEEMS TO BE POOR CRAFTSMANSHIP ON BEHALF OF THE MANUFACTURER, AND AFTER RESEARCHING SIMILAR CONCERNS ONLINE REVEALS AN ABUNDANCE OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS OF CONTINUED FUEL SYSTEM REPAIRS/MALFUNCTIONS OF OTHER CHEVY COBALT OWNERS FOR THE SAME YEAR VEHICLE. \\r\\n\\r\\nIT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE A VEHICLE THAT CONSISTENTLY HAS A COMPROMISED FUEL SYSTEM, AND DEEMS FURTHER RESPONSE AND ACCOUNTABILITY FROM THE MANUFACTURER TO THE EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED A VEHICLE THAT IS DANGEROUS TO OPERATE, AND HAVE BEEN PLACED UNDER THE UNNECESSARY FINANCIAL BURDEN OF REPEAT REPAIRS AND CONCERNS.\",\n",

THE SENSATION WAS THAT OF THE ENGINE SUDDENLY SURGING AND ACCELERATING.  I WAS FORTUNATELY ABLE TO APPLY HARDER PRESSURE TO THE BRAKE PEDAL, REGAINED CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND AVOIDED CRASHING INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  I SPOKE WITH A TOYOTA FIELD TECHNICAL SPECIALIST TODAY WHO TOLD ME THAT THE MECHANICS OF THE CAR ARE SUCH THAT IF A WHEEL HITS A BUMP OR MOVES ONTO A SURFACE THAT CAUSES IT TO ROTATE AT A DIFFERENT RATE VERSUS THE OTHER WHEELS, THE CAR THINKS IT IS GOING INTO A SKID, AND THE ABS SYSTEM KICKS IN.  ALSO, THE SYSTEM THAT GENERATES ENERGY TO RECHARGE THE BATTERY, WHICH ALSO EFFECTIVELY BRAKES THE CAR, SUDDENLY CEASES TO OPERATE.  CONSEQUENTLY, YOU HAVE THE SENSATION OF ACCELERATION WHEN IN FACT, ACCORDING TO THE TOYOTA SPECIALIST, THE CAR STOPPED DECELERATING.  NONETHELESS, THIS SUDDEN DECELERATION IS UNEXPECTED, AND IF I WAS NOT FOCUSED AT THOSE EXACT MOMENTS AND FAILED TO IMMEDIATELY APPLY SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE TO THE BRAKE PEDAL, I COULD HAVE EASILY CRASHED INTO AN OBJECT, OR CAR, OR PERSON, IN FRONT OF ME.   \\r\\nI DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN THIS CAR, AND AM WORRIED THAT MY WIFE OR SON COULD HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM RESPONDING TO THIS SUDDEN LACK OF CONTROL.

SINCE PURCHASED ON 8/2009, I HAD MORE THAN TEN EXPERIENCES OF UNEXPECTED ACCELERATION (SUDDEN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION) ON REVERSE THAT FEEL LIKE TWO OR THREE TIME (STRONGER) FASTER THAN NORMAL REVERSE. ACCOMPANY THE HIGHER SPEED REVERSE, A HEAVY, ABRUPT BRAKING WITH A SLIGHT TOUCH OF THE BRAKE DURING THIS EVENT. THE BIG \"JERK\" (BRAKING) ROCK THE ENTIRE CAR AND BANGED  HEADS AGAIN THE HEADRESTS.THIS ONLY HAPPENED WITH ELECTRIC MODE AND MOST TIME WITH THE CAR PARKED A SLIGHT INCLINE. THIS UNINTENDED ACCELERATION SOMETIME HAPPEN A FEW TIME A DAY OR IT CAN GO TWO, THREE WEEKS WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM. THE DEALER CAN NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH MY CAR. AND TOYOTA HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER, IF YOU GO TO PRIUSCHAT FORUM UNDER GEN III 2010 PRIUS MAIN FORUM-BRAKING IN REVERSE, THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS IF A NEW DRIVER GET IN MY CAR AND NOT KNOW ABOUT IT.  THERE IS ONE POST IN PRIUSCHAT FORUM THAT BEST EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM: JUST YESTERDAY, MY PRIUS-III BACKED UP WITH SUDDEN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION, WITH MY FOOT ONLY ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.... I RECOGNIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE IT HAPPENED ONCE BEFORE, JUST OVER 2 MONTHS AGO. JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER I GOT THE CAR. WHEN I WAS BACKING OUT OF AN INCLINED DRIVEWAY...  I SUSPECT THAT SOME UNUSUAL ELEMENT OF THE TIMING OF TURNING THE CAR ON AND SHIFTING INTO REVERSE, AND POSSIBLY THE INTERNAL STATE OF THE COMPUTER AND THE HYBRID POWER SYSTEM COMBINE TO PRODUCE THIS \"ABRUPT\" REVERSE ACCELERATION AS I AM GENTLY EASING OFF MY FOOT PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL... THE ABRUPT BRAKING EFFECT DOES OCCUR, BUT ONLY IN RESPONSE TO THE MUCH MORE DANGEROUS \"UNEXPECTED, UNINTENDED\" REVERSE POWER (ACCELERATION), TO STOP THE CAR MOTION. NO MATTER HOW GENTLY THE BRAKE IS EASED FURTHER ON TO STOP, THE STOP IS \"ABRUPT\"  BY GARYGID ORANGE COUNTY, CA. I AM TRYING TO WORK WITH TOYOTA ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. *TR',\n",

ON THREE OCCASIONS, I HAVE EXPERIENCED A SITUATION WHERE THE BRAKES SUDDENLY RELEASED, AND I HAD TO SLAM ON THE BRAKE PEDAL TO PREVENT AN ACCIDENT.  TWO OF THE SITUATIONS HAPPENED WHEN I WAS COMING TO A STOP NEAR AN INTERSECTION (I WAS MOVING INTO A LEFT TURN LANE, AND SUDDENLY THE BRAKES RELEASED).  THE THIRD TIME WAS WHILE EXITING A FREEWAY, WHEN I HIT A POTHOLE, AND I FELT THE BRAKE RELEASE.  AFTER THE THIRD EXPERIENCE, I RECALLED THAT, PERHAPS, THE CAR RAN OVER A SMALL BUMP WHEN I WAS MOVING INTO THE LEFT TURN LANE, AND THAT MAY HAVE HELPED TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF THE BRAKE PEDAL.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE TOYOTA DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED IT, BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING WRONG.

WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED, I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ROAD AND IGNORED IT. WHEN IT WAS MORE PRONOUNCED AND HAPPENED A COUPLE OF MORE TIMES, I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER. THEY SAID THEY HAD NO OTHER REPORTS AND COULD NOT REPLICATE IT. THE SERVICE MANAGER TOOK ME ON A TEST DRIVE AND THE CAR WAS FINE. I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN AS THE ACCELERATION IS ONLY OCCASIONAL. I WAS ADVISED TO CALL TOYOTA NATIONAL, WHICH I DID, AND WAS TOLD THAT SINCE THIS COULD NOT BE REPLICATED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AND NO RECOURSE I HAD AS THE COMPLAINT COULD NOT BE REPLICATED. IT HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE, SO I HAVE PAID CLOSE ATTENTION, AS MY HEART HAS BEEN RACING, TO THE CONDITIONS. IT HAS HAPPENED WHEN I AM BRAKING WHILE GOING OVER MANHOLES, SPEED STRIPS, CRACKS IN THE PAVEMENT. IT FEELS LIKE THE TIRE IS GETTING HUNG UP SLIGHTLY, DOESN'T GET ANY TRACTION.THE BRAKE MALFUNCTION LIGHT COMES ON. ALSO, ON THE MULTI-INFORMATION DISPLAY, THE INDICATOR HAS JUST MOVED FROM ECO TO CHG.THE OTHER DAY, IT WAS 34 DEGREES AND I WAS BRAKING AS I CAME UP TO A LIGHT AND THE CAR SLID AND VIBRATED. I WAS GOING ABOUT 5 MILES AN HOUR. THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME BLACK ICE OR FROST ON THE GROUND, BUT THE SHAKING WAS INTENSE AND I HAD DIFFICULTY CONTROLLING THE CAR FOR A FEW SECONDS UNTIL I STOPPED. *TR\",\n",

IT DOES IT EVERY TIME A CERTAIN POTHOLE IS HIT - THAT IS, WE CAN REPRODUCE THE LURCHING. THIS LURCHING, WHICH FEELS LIKE AN UNEXPECTED ACCELERATION, SIGNIFICANTLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY INCREASES THE STOPPING DISTANCE.  THIS HAS ALMOST RESULTED IN THE PRIUS STRIKING THE CAR IN FRONT OF IT.  IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SAFELY JUDGE YOUR BRAKING DISTANCE IN ORDER TO COME TO A SAFE STOP BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THIS PHENOMENON WILL OCCUR.  THIS ALSO PUTS PEDESTRIANS IN THE CROSS WALK AT RISK, SINCE THE ABILITY TO STOP ACCURATELY IS AFFECTED.  WE HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO THE DEALER TWICE.  THEY ARE ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE PHENOMENA.  HOWEVER, THEY SAY THAT THE CAR TESTS OUT \"WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS\", THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE, THAT IT IS JUST THE WAY IT IS MADE, AND THAT WE JUST HAVE TO GET USED TO IT.  THEY SAY THERE IS NOTHING TO FIX OR REPAIR.  THEY TOOK ANOTHER 2010 PRIUS OFF OF THEIR LOT AND RAN IT OVER THE SAME POT HOLE AND IT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. AN ARTICLE BY PAUL A. EISENSTEIN, MSNBC.COM CONTRIBUTOR, UPDATED 7:29 A.M. ET, TUES., DEC. 29, 2009 DESCRIBES EXACTLY THE PROBLEM WE ARE HAVING, AND IT SEEMS TO BE RELATED TO THE BRAKING SYSTEM.  THIS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM WITH ONLY MY VEHICLE - IT APPEARS TO BE A FLEET-WIDE PROBLEM.  HAVING THE BRAKES CUT OUT UNEXPECTEDLY IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN.

THE DRIVER NEEDS TO RELEASE THE BRAKE PEDAL AND RE-APPLY PRESSURE FOR THE BRAKE TO RE-ENGAGE. THE PROBLEM DOES NOT OCCUR EVERY DAY BUT IT HAS OCCURRED OFTEN ENOUGH THAT BOTH DRIVERS OF OUR CAR HAVE NOTICED THIS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS DURING THE SIX MONTHS THAT WE HAVE OWNED THE CAR. IT APPEARS TO OCCUR MORE AT SPEEDS BELOW 15 MPH, ON DOWNHILL SLOPES, IN COLDER WEATHER AND ON SLIPPERY ROADS. GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PROBLEM TENDS TO HAPPEN WHEN APPROACHING INTERSECTIONS, WHERE MOST BRAKING TAKES PLACE, MAKING IT A MORE DANGEROUS DEFECT. WE PURCHASED THE CAR AT THE END OF JULY, 2009. WE REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WHEN THE CAR WAS IN FOR ITS FIRST 5000 MILE SERVICE IN JANUARY, 2010. THEY ROAD-TESTED THE CAR BUT COULD NOT REPLICATE OUR EXPERIENCE, SO THEY COULD NOT DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE. *TR\",\n",

THIS MAINLY SEEMS TO OCCUR WHEN THE SURFACE CHANGES WHILE BRAKING, LIKE DRIVING OVER A MANHOLE COVER, POTHOLE OR SLIPPERY SURFACE.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS EVERY SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR IN JUNE 2009.  I REPORTED IT TO THE DEALER AT MY FIRST CHECK-UP, AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS A FUNCTION OF THE UNIQUE BRAKING SYSTEM ON THE PRIUS, AND THAT THEY HADN'T HEARD THE COMPLAINT BEFORE (TOO NEW IN THE MODEL YEAR).  NO RECORD WAS MADE OF MY COMPLAINT.  I HAVE LIVED WITH IT EVER SINCE, AND IT HAPPENS AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK; JUST HAPPENED AGAIN YESTERDAY.  AT ONE INTERSECTION ON MY COMMUTE I HIT THE SAME SURFACE EVERY TIME AND IT LURCHES ALMOST EVERY TIME.  IT FEELS ALMOST AS IF I HAVE LIFTED MY FOOT OFF THE  BRAKE PEDAL AND IT LURCHES FORWARD, ALTHOUGH I CAN'T SAY IF IT FEELS LIKE IT IS ACCELERATING OR IF IT IS JUST THE INERTIA OF THE CAR THAT CAUSES IT TO LURCH FORWARD.  IT HAS NOT CAUSED AN ACCIDENT YET, BUT SINCE THE CAR LURCHES A FEW FEET FORWARD, I KNOW THAT I WOULD HIT ANY CAR TOO CLOSE IN FRONT OF ME.  I ALSO WORRY THAT IN SNOW OR ICE IT WOULD CAUSE A SKID TO OCCUR OR SEND ME INTO A DIFFERENT LANE.  I WAS NOT AT ALL SURPRISED TO HEAR ABOUT THIS ON THE NEWS THIS MORNING, AND REGRET THAT I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS COMPLAINT FORM TO FILE OR I WOULD HAVE BACK IN JULY.

IF THE CAR IS SLOWING GRADUALLY WITH REGENERATIVE BRAKING ACTIVE AND THE ROAD SURFACE CHANGES DUE TO A POTHOLE, UNEVEN/BROKEN SURFACE, OR SPEED BUMP, THE HYDRAULIC BRAKING IS REENGAGED VERY SLOWLY. THIS CAUSES THE CAR TO APPEAR TO ACCELERATE FOR A SECOND OR TWO UNTIL HYDRAULIC BRAKING IS ENGAGED BY THE CAR'S COMPUTER OR BECAUSE THE DRIVER HAD TO INCREASE BRAKE PEDAL PRESSURE DRAMATICALLY TO SLOW/STOP THE CAR.\\r\\n\\r\\nI HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REPRODUCE THIS DAILY ON A NUMBER OF THE ROADS I CONSISTENTLY TRAVEL. SPEED DURING THESE INCIDENTS IS USUALLY ANYWHERE BETWEEN 5 AND 30 MPH.\\r\\n\\r\\nONE EXAMPLE: DRIVING ON A ROAD AND COMING TO A STOP LIGHT... SLOWING GRADUALLY ON REGEN BRAKING, THEN I HIT A PART OF THE ROAD WHERE THERE IS AN UNEVEN SURFACE. REGEN BRAKING STOPS AND CAR COASTS WITH NO BRAKING, SOMETIMES FOR UP TO A SECOND OR TWO. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHIS IS A MAJOR CONCERN AS IT COULD RESULT IN A CAR ACCIDENT OR PEDESTRIAN DEATH. I HAVE ALREADY HAD AT LEAST TWO NEAR MISSES WHERE I HAVE HAD TO SLOW OR STOP SUDDENLY WHILE BRAKING IN REGEN MODE AND THE SWITCH TO HYDRAULIC MODE IS SEVERELY DELAYED.

I HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN 10 TIMES SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR IN OCT OF 09.  IN THE FIRST MONTH THE DEALER TOLD ME THEY HAD NOT HEARD OF THIS. TWO MONTHS AGO (DEC)A MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE ELECTRIC ENGINE KICKS IN (WHEN REGENATIVE BREAKING) WHICH DRIVES THE FRONT WHEELS FOR A SMOOTHER BREAKING, SO HE SURMISED THAT IF THE BREAKING WHEELS ARE NOT MAKING CONTACT THE CAR WOULD SPEED UP.  ON 1/13/2010 I MET WITH THE HEAD OF SERVICE FOR THE DEALERSHIP.  HE TOLD ME THAT THE DEALERSHIP TESTED A PRIUS HOOKING IT UP TO A COMPUTER AND REPRODUCED THE ENVIRONMENT OF THIS COMPLAINT. ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THERE WAS A MOMENTARY LACK OF BREAKING WITH THE LOSS OF BACK WHEEL CONTACT WITH THE PAVEMENT HE CLAIMED THERE WAS NO ACCELERATION NOTED.  HE ALSO ADMITTED THE TEST WAS DONE AT APPROX. 25MPH.  I SUGGESTED HE SHOULD REPEAT THE TEST AT 40-50MPH AS THIS IS WHERE IT IS MOST NOTABLE.  TOYOTA'S ONLY SUGGESTION IS TO DRIVE CAREFULLY.  THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM BUT THIS IS THERE SOLUTION.  I HAVE BEEN CAREFUL BUT ON 1/31/10 I WAS DRIVING AT 45MPH BEGINNING TO DECELERATE AS THE LIGHT AHEAD HAD TURNED RED, AND THE TRUCK INFRONT OF ME HAD TO PANIC STOP AS A CAR CUT INFRONT OF HIM, AT THAT MOMENT MY REAR LEFT WHEEL HIT A POTHOLE SO I WAS NOT ABLE TO BRAKE AND ACTUALLY ACCELERATED TOWARD THE BACK OF THIS TRUCK.  WHEN THE BRAKES REENGAGED I ACTUALLY STOPPED 12 INCHES FROM HIS BUMPER.

THE CROSSING ITSELF IS IN  ANN ARBOR, MI, ON W. WILLIAM ST. BETWEEN S. ASHLEY ST AND S. 1ST ST.

AT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS WAS NORMAL, THAT PERHAPS THE CAR WAS JUST SLIPPING, BUT NOW IT SEEMS AS IF THIS REPRESENTS THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION IN JAPAN. THE PROBLEM IS 100% REPRODUCIBLE. TYPICAL TRAVEL SPEEDS ARE 15-30 MILES PER HOUR. THE BRAKING ACTION IS ONLY INTERRUPTED WHILE TRAVELING OVER THE BUMPY SURFACE OF THE RAIL TRACKS, AND THEN BRAKING ACTION IS RESTORED. HOWEVER, IF THERE ARE CARS QUEUED UP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL AT THE INTERSECTION, IT OFTEN LEADS TO SHORT BRAKING TIMES AND HAS CAUSED CONCERN REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE BRAKES.\\r\\n\\r\\nI HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO MY DEALERSHIP REGARDING THE PROBLEM, NOR HAD ANY SERVICE PERFORMED ON THE VEHICLE REGARDING THE PROBLEM.

THAT BREAK-IN PERIOD WAS DEFINED AS 5000 MILES AND I AM NOW AT ABOUT 4800, AND THE PROBLEM HAS NOT CHANGED. WHEN I REPORTED IT TO THE DEALER, I HAD ABOUT 3000 MILES ON THE CAR, AND IT WAS ABOUT ONE MONTH AFTER PURCHASE (EARLY JANUARY). AT THE TIME, THE BRAKES WERE CHECKED AND NO PROBLEM WAS IDENTIFIED.

THE ABS ALSO WENT ON A COUPLE OF TIMES EVEN WITHOUT ME PUTTING MY FOOT ON THE BRAKES. THE TIRE DEALER SAID HE THOUGHT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE FRAME AND TOLD US NOT TO DRIVE THE CAR. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO A NEARBY BODY SHOP TO BE INSPECTED BY OUR INSURANCE COMPANY, STATE FARM. AS OF FEBRUARY 2, 2010 NO INSPECTION HAS TAKEN PLACE.

I HAVE TWO SAFETY RELATED COMPLAINTS TO REPORT WITH THE BRAKING SYSTEM:\\r\\nCOMPLAINT #1 - SEVERAL TIMES (PERHAPS 10-15) WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES AFTER COASTING A SHORT DISTANCE AS I PREPARE TO STOP, I HAVE MOMENTARILY LOST ALL BRAKING.  IT FEELS AS IF I HAVE HIT A PATCH OF GLARE ICE WITH ALL FOUR WHEELS.  IT ALWAYS HAPPENS THE MOMENT I FIRST APPLY THE BRAKES, AND THEN AFTER A MOMENT (PERHAPS A SECOND OR LESS) THE BRAKING SYSTEM RETURNS TO NORMAL OPERATION.  FOR THAT BRIEF TIME THERE IS NO BRAKING ACTION AT ALL.\\r\\nCOMPLAINT #2 - SEVERAL TIMES (PERHAPS 8-10) WHEN TAKING THE CAR FROM \"PARK\" TO \"REVERSE\" TO BACK OUT OF A PARKING SPACE, THE BRAKING SYSTEM IS SO SENSITIVE THAT IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL THE CAR\\'S SPEED.  THE BRAKE PEDAL HAS NEARLY NO \"PLAY\" OR \"FEEL\" TO IT, CAUSING THE CAR TO JERK TO A STOP WHEN THE SLIGHTEST PRESSURE IS APPLIED.  THIS RESULTS IN A PATTERN OF \"COAST A FEW FEET AND JERK TO A STOP, COAST A FEW FEET AND JERK TO A STOP\", REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES WHILE BACKING UP THE NECESSARY 30 +/- FEET.

       "   'Summary': 'I HAVE A 2010 PRIUS AND SAW AN ARTICLE ABOUT THERE BEING POSSIBLE BRAKE PROBLEMS WITH THE MODEL.  I HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM PROBABLY ABOUT 6 TIMES SINCE I GOT THE CAR LAST JULY AND, WHEN I MENTIONED IT TO THE DEALER, THEY SAID THERE WASN\\'T ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE BRAKES WHEN THEY RAN THE DIAGNOSTIC.  WHEN IT HAPPENS, I\\'M IN THE PROCESS OF BRAKING, AND THERE\\'S A \"PUSH\", ALMOST LIKE THE BRAKES DIDN\\'T \"TAKE\", FOLLOWED BY A LOSS OF STEERING FOR A SECOND OR TWO.  IT\\'S ALSO HAPPENED TO MY HUSBAND ONE TIME.  THERE DOESN\\'T SEEM TO BE ANY RHYME OR REASON AS TO WHEN IT HAPPENS (WET ROAD VS. DRY ROAD, TURNING OR GOING STRAIGHT, FLAT OR HILL).  I ORIGINALLY ASSOCIATED THE PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES BECAUSE I ALSO HAVE THE \"SLIDING\" ICON COME ON  THE DASHBOARD WHEN I\\'M COMPLETELY STOPPED AND LEAN FORWARD IN MY SEATBELT.  HOWEVER, I\\'M NOW WONDERING IF IT\\'S NOT THE BRAKES, BUT THE TRANSMISSION, SINCE IT SORT OF FEELS LIKE IT\\'S NOT DOWNSHIFTING WHEN IT\\'S SUPPOSED TO, OR IT SHIFTS BACK INTO A HIGHER GEAR FOR A SECOND WHILE BRAKING.  I CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION AFTER WAITING IN THE CAR WHILE IT WAS RUNNING.  WITH THE CAR ON, EMERGENCY BRAKE ON, BUT NOT IN PARK, THERE WAS A DEFINITE \"JOLT\" WHEN THE GAS ENGINE WOULD TURN ON AND THEN OFF AGAIN A FEW MINUTES LATER.  ALTHOUGH THERE HASN\\'T BEEN A CRASH YET, THERE WERE TWO TIMES WHEN IT CAME REALLY CLOSE TO THAT, AS I WAS TURNING AND ALMOST HIT THE CARS ON THE SIDE STREET THAT WERE IN THE LEFT TURN LANE WAITING TO TURN ONTO THE STREET I HAD BEEN TRAVELING ON. *TR',\n",

THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES THIS HAPPENED, IT WAS RATHER FRIGHTENING BECAUSE THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME HAD STOPPED, AND I FELT AS IF I WERE ACCELERATING. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHIS IS A REPRODUCIBLE EVENT THAT OCCURS AT A KNOWN LOCATION THAT I SIMPLY AVOID. THE ROAD IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA IS ALSO DOWN SLOPE, WHICH LENDS TO THE ACCELERATION FEELING. I HAVE DRIVEN MY 2010 PRIUS OVER THIS SAME AREA WITH VERY MUCH THE SAME RESULT. \\r\\n\\r\\nMY INITIAL ASSESSMENT WAS THAT THE TRACTION CONTROL TOOK OVER TO REGAIN TRACTION, HOWEVER I WOULD NOT THING THIS IS ACCEPTABLE. THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP SAID THIS IS NORMAL BEHAVIOR AND IS NOT A PROBLEM. \\r\\n\\r\\nPLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME AND I CAN DESCRIBE BETTER THE CONDITIONS FOR THIS VERY REPRODUCIBLE EVENT. *TR',\n",

THIS OCCURRED WHILE I APPLIED THE BRAKES. I WENT OVER A BUMP OR POTHOLE. IT SEEMED LIKE THE CAR ACTUALLY ACCELERATED MOMENTARILY AND I HAD TO  KEEP APPLYING THE BRAKES TO THE FLOOR AND HOPED THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH DISTANCE TO STOP. I REMEMBER GOING DOWN A HILL, APPLYING THE BRAKES  AND THE CAR WAS SLOWING DOWN, THEN I WENT OVER THE BUMP OR POTHOLE IN THE ROAD AND THE CAR TOOK OFF LIKE I WAS ACCELERATING. I FELT LIKE I HAD LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE FOR AT LEAST 2 SECONDS OR 20FEET  BUT FORTUNATELY NO OTHER VEHICLES WERE NEAR BY. I NOW MAKE SURE THAT I BRAKE SOONER, AND ALLOW MORE FOLLOWING DISTANCE. ESPECIALLY IN BAD WEATHER. ANTI-LOCK BRAKES SEEM TO HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE PROBLEMS IN THAT THE WHEELS DON'T LOCK BUT  THOSE ON THE PRIUS SEEM A BIT MORE NOTICEABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE ELECTRIC AND THE PADS DON'T SLOW THE CAR LIKE NORMAL BRAKES. (AT LEAST THAT WHAT MY SALESMAN TOLD ME.) HE SAID THAT THE PADS WILL LAST OVER 200,000 MILES. HOPEFULLY I'LL BE ABLE TO DRIVE IT THAT LONG WITHOUT AN INCIDENT.

JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I DEFINITELY NOTICED THIS ISSUE IN MY NEW PRIUS.  APPROXIMATELY ONCE A MONTH, WHEN I'M BRAKING OVER AN UNEVEN OR SLIPPERY SURFACE, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE CAR GOING OVER THE SLIPPERY SURFACE, WHILE I'M BRAKING, THERE IS A MOMENT LASTING LESS THAN A SECOND WHERE IT FEELS LIKE THE BRAKES DISENGAGE.  (CAUSES YOUR HEART TO SKIP A BEAT WHEN IT HAPPENS.)\\r\\n\\r\\nI ALSO NOTICED A SEPARATE QUIRK THE OTHER DAY THAT I WANT TO PASS ON TO YOU.  I'M NOT SURE IF THIS WAS DONE DELIBERATELY BY TOYOTA OR WHETHER THIS IS A DEFECT, HOWEVER, I BELIEVE MY SPEEDOMETER IS CALIBRATED SO THAT IT READS A SPEED THAT IS 2 MPH FASTER THAN MY ACTUAL SPEED.  I NOTICED THIS WHEN I WENT ON A TRIP AND USED MY WIFE'S TOM TOM, WHICH USES ITS GPS SIGNAL TO MEASURE THE SPEED OF THE CAR.  THE TOM TOM IS USUALLY SPOT ON IN MY WIFE'S ACURA.  IN THE PRIUS, IT WAS INDICATING THAT MY TRUE SPEED WAS 2 MPH LESS THAN WHAT MY SPEEDOMETER INDICATED.  I'M WONDERING IF THIS WASN'T SOMEHOW INTENTIONALLY DONE BY TOYOTA TO GET BETTER PERCEIVED GAS MILEAGE BY THE DRIVER.  HAVING THE CAR GET OVER THE 50 MPG THRESHOLD IS A BIG MARKETING ADVANTAGE FOR THEM.  GETTING OVER THIS THRESHOLD WOULD BE EASIER IF THE ACTUAL SPEED OF THE CAR WAS LESS THAN THE PERCEIVED SPEED.  *TW\",\n",

AFTER HEARING ON THE RADIO AND TV THIS WEEK ABOUT OTHER BUYERS EXPERIENCING THE SAME BRAKING ISSUE I HAVE BEEN OCCASIONALLY EXPERIENCING, I DECIDED TO LET YOU KNOW IT'S HAPPENING TO ME TOO. NAMELY, THERE IS A MOMENT WHEN I AM BRAKING AT A SPEED OF ABOUT 15-25 MPH, IN PREPARATION TO SLOW DOWN FOR A RIGHT TURN AT ONE PARTICULAR INTERSECTION--IT HAS A LARGE POTHOLE. IF I ROLL OVER THE POTHOLE WITH MY FRONT RIGHT TIRE, THE CAR SEEMS TO SPEED UP FOR A FEW SECONDS--INSTEAD OF SLOWING DOWN--AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT APPLYING MORE BRAKE PRESSURE CAN DO. SOMETIMES I'VE NOTICED THIS KIND OF PROBLEM WHEN TRYING TO SLOW DOWN ON A PATCH OF BLACK ICE, BUT THAT SEEMS TYPICAL OF THE DIFFICULTY OF BRAKING ON BLACK ICE. THE POTHOLE ISSUE HAPPENS INVARIABLY AT THAT PARTICULAR POTHOLE, SO I HAVE HAD TO SWERVE TO AVOID ROLLING OVER IT. THERE ARE OTHER POTHOLES THAT I'VE NOTICED CAN CAUSE ME THIS PROBLEM, BUT NONE WITH SUCH FREQUENCY AS THAT. THE GROUND IS LEVEL THERE, SO IT'S NOT A DOWNHILL PROBLEM. *TR\",\n",

AS I APPLIED THE BREAKS, THE CAR BEGAN A SERIES OF QUICK FORWARD JERKS ASSOCIATED WITH KNOCKING SOUNDS.   I ALSO HEARD A SLIGHT CHANGE IN HOW THE ENGINE SOUNDED.  FORTUNATELY, I ESCAPED A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT SINCE MY PRIUS DRIFTED TO THE RIGHT BEFORE CONTROL WAS REESTABLISHED.   IT WAS FRIGHTENING.   \\r\\n\\r\\nTHIS IS THE FIRST CAR I HAVE OWNED THAT HAS AN ANTI LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM.    I ASSUMED THAT IS WHY I EXPERIENCED THE LOSS OF CONTROL AND WHY IT FELT SO UNCOMFORTABLE.   WHEN I TOLD THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT IT, I WAS ADVISED TO TAKE THE CAR TO AN OPEN AREA AND PRACTICE USING THE BRAKES IN ORDER TO GET USED TO IT.   SINCE THEN, MY HUSBAND HAS HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE WHILE TRYING TO STOP THE CAR ON ICY ROADS.    HE TELLS ME THAT THE \"JERKING\" AND THE KNOCKING SOUND IS NOT PART OF A NORMAL ANTI LOCK BREAKING SYSTEM.    THIS IS WHY I AM REPORTING OUR EXPERIENCE TO THE U.S. NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION.    THANK YOU. *TR\\r\\n\\r\\n    ',\n",

THERE WERE WET LEAVES IN THE STREET AND WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES, THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN NOTHING HAPPENED. THEN IT FELT AS IF THE ABS SYSTEM ACTUATED AND MOMENTARILY THE BRAKES LOCKED UP AND THE CAR STARTED TO SKID, THEN THE ABS TOOK OVER AND THE CAR CAME TO A STOP. TRUTHFULLY I WAS FRIGHTENED. I HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE SINCE SEPTEMBER, 2009 AND THIS HAS OCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES. I WAS LUCKY ONE TIME WHEN IT HAPPENED IN TRAFFIC WHEN THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME STOPPED SUDDENLY. I WAS SURE I WAS GOING TO HIT THE OTHER VEHICLE BUT IT MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH SO THAT I DID NOT HIT IT. I HAVE NOTICED THAT IT OCCURS MOST OFTEN WHEN THE STREET OR HIGHWAY IS ROUGH OR BUMPY IN THE AREA WHERE I AM BRAKING. IT IS ESPECIALLY TREACHEROUS HERE IN MINNEAPOLIS WHEN THE STREETS ARE SLICK FROM SNOW OR ICE. I CERTAINLY HAVE LEARNED TO GIVE THE OTHER CAR PLENTY OF ROOM SO THAT I WILL HAVE TIME TO BRAKE.

ON BOTH OCCASIONS, I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK AND WENT OVER A SPOT ON THE ROAD WHICH, BECAUSE IT WAS DARK, I COULDN¿T SEE FOR SURE, BUT WHICH FELT LIKE A POT HOLE.  (I ALSO THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN RAINING ON BOTH OF THESE OCCASIONS, ALTHOUGH I CAN¿T RECALL FOR SURE).  IMMEDIATELY AFTER HITTING WHAT I THINK WAS A POT HOLE, I FELT THE CAR SUDDENLY AND DRAMATICALLY ACCELERATE.  BOTH TIMES I APPLIED THE BRAKES AND THE CAR STOPPED ACCELERATING.  AT THE TIME, IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME WHAT WAS GOING ON.  BUT, NOW THINKING ABOUT IT, I THINK IT LIKELY THAT THE SUDDEN JOLT TO THE CAR, PERHAPS COMBINED WITH MOISTURE, CAUSED SOME TYPE OF ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTION, WHICH THANKFULLY, WAS SHORT-LIVED (OR AT LEAST STOPPED BY BRAKING).

       "   'Summary': \"I WANT TO REPORT A MOMENTARY BRAKE FAILURE OF 2010 PRIUS OVER UNEVEN ROADS 2 MONTHS AGO. I DIDN'T REPORT IT EARLIER BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS A ONE-OFF OR SYSTEMATIC ISSUE. TWO MONTHS AGO, I WAS DRIVING A NEWLY OWNED PRIUS WITH HARDLY 4000 MILES ON IT OVER A STRETCH OF RT. 93 FROM ANDOVER TO BOSTON. I WAS TRAVELING AT ABOUT 65 - 70 MPH ON THE LEFT FASTEST LANE. I CAM ACROSS A BUMPY PATCH, PROBABLY THE ROAD WAS BEING REPAIRED, AND IT WAS NOT LATE FOR ME TO SLOW DOWN AS I DIDN'T EXPECT SUCH UNEVENNESS ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY. I STEPPED ON THE BRAKE WHILE THE CAR WAS BEING TOSSED UP AND DOWN BY THE BUMPS AND I IMMEDIATELY FELT THAT THE CAR LOST BRAKING. LUCKILY, THERE WAS NO CAR AHEAD OF ME AND THE BRAKING DID RECOVER AFTER THE CAR SETTLED DOWN. I OWNED 4 TOYOTA'S FROM SUV TO THE HYBRID AND PRIUS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS THIS PROBLEM. I JUST WANT TO SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE'S COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS CAR. I MUST SAY THAT THE BRAKING DID RECOVER QUICKLY THAT A COLLISION WAS NOT LIKELY UNLESS SOMEONE DRIVE THE CAR VERY FAST ON AN UNEVEN ROAD THAT IS ALSO CROWDED. HOWEVER, A CAR SHOULD NOT BEHAVE LIKE THIS UNDER ANY CONDITIONS.  *JB\",\n",

ON SUNDAY, JANUARY 31, 2010 I WAS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD APPROACHING A \"T\" INTERSECTION AT A STOP SIGN. THE MAIN ROADS HAD BEEN CLEARED OF ICE BUT THERE WAS SOME ICE REMAINING ON OUR STREET. I WAS TRAVELING VERY SLOWLY, PUT ON MY BRAKES AND NOTHING HAPPENED. THEN I TRIED PUMPING THE BRAKES SINCE I GOT NO RESPONSE OTHERWISE. I SLID THROUGH THE STOP SIGN, TRIED TO TURN MY TIRES TO THE LEFT TO AVOID THE CURB AND ENDED UP JUMPING THE CURB WITH BOTH FRONT TIRES. ON INSPECTION WHEN I GOT HOME (4 HOUSES DOWN FROM THE INCIDENT) I NOTICED THE RIM OF THE RIGHT TIRE HAD BEEN CRACKED AND THE TIRE HAD SOME DAMAGE. I HAD TO WORK ON MON & TUES AND DID NOT DRIVE THE CAR ON THOSE DAYS. YESTERDAY, 02/03/10 I TOOK THE CAR TO HIBDON TIRES (2 BLOCKS AWAY) SINCE THE DEALERSHIP IS OVER 30 MILES AWAY AND I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE IT ON THE HIGHWAY. THEY PUT ON THE SPARE TIRE AND DETERMINED THAT THE PASSENGER RIM WAS NOT REPAIRABLE, THE DRIVER RIM WAS INTACT AND BOTH TIRES WERE INTACT AND REUSABLE. THEY INDICATED THE AXLE DID NOT APPEAR DAMAGED. I ORDERED ANOTHER TOYOTA RIM TO MATCH ($411.20) AND WITH AN ALIGNMENT ($65.00) I WAS QUOTED A TOTAL PRICE OF $512.26. \\r\\n\\r\\n     I CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALER TODAY (02/05/10) AFTER READING THE MEDIA REPORTS ABOUT COMPLAINTS BY OTHER PRIUS OWNERS DESCRIBING  THE VERY SITUATION THAT HAPPENED TO ME.

MY CAR BEGAN TO BUCK AND JUMP AND I HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME CAUSING OVER $10,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE TO MY 2010 TOYOTA PRIUS.  MY CAR WAS TOWED AND REPAIRED BY TOYOTA OF DALLAS.  I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE DEALERSHIP AS WELL AS TO STATE FARM.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS TOLD ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES IN MY VEHICLE.  THEY CLAIM I MUST HAVE BEEN TRAVELING TOO FAST OR TOO CLOSE TO THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME.  I WAS NOT ISSUED A CITATION BY THE SHERIFF.  MY AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY AS I WAS TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 12 MPH.  I CONTINUED TO COMPLAIN TO TOYOTA ABOUT THE BRAKES AND THEY SENT AN ENGINEER TO EXAMINE MY VEHICLE ON TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 2 WHO AGAIN TOLD ME THAT THERE WERE NO ISSUES WITH MY BRAKES.

LOSS OF BRAKING WHEN SLOWING DOWN OVER ROUGH OR UNEVEN PAVEMENT, GRAVEL, WET LEAVES, SNOW, ICE, CRACKED PAVEMENT, POT HOLES...  THE BRAKES ENGAGE FOR A SECOND, AND THEN WE EXPERIENCE NO BRAKING AT ALL FOR NUMBER OF SECONDS.  WE TOOK OUR PRIUS INTO JON LANCASTER TOYOTA IN MADISON, WI WHERE WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND TOLD THE MECHANIC OF THE BRAKING ISSUES WE WERE EXPERIENCING .  HE CHECKED OUT THE VEHICLE AND SAID HE COULD NOT FIND ANY ISSUES WITH THE BRAKING SYSTEM AND SAID THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM AND NEITHER HAD TOYOTA. THIS LACK OF BRAKING RESULTED IN A REAR END COLLISION IN DECEMBER 2009.  MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING AT VERY LOW SPEED IN TOWN ONE EVENING AND THIS LACK OF BRAKING ISSUE OCCURRED AND HE SLID INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE. MY HUSBAND PUMPED THE BRAKES FOUR TIMES AND EACH TIME THIS DELAY IN BRAKING OCCURRED.  THERE WAS NO BRAKING HAPPENING AT ALL.  THE CAR WAS SLOWING DOWN FASTER WHEN THE BRAKES WERE NOT APPLIED, THAN WHEN THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED.  THERE WAS FRESH SNOW ON THE ROAD.  THERE WAS A DANE COUNTY SHERIFF AT THE INTERSECTION AND MY HUSBAND AND THE PERSON HE HIT RAN THE INCIDENT BY THE STATE PATROL WHO AGREED THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR THE TWO PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT TO EXCHANGE INSURANCE AND CONTACT INFORMATION AND LEAVE THE SCENE WITHOUT CALLING THE LOCAL POLICE.  THERE WAS DAMAGE TO OUR PRIUS FRONT BUMPER, AND TO THE BACK BUMPER OF THE OTHER VEHICLE.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. OCCASIONALLY WHEN STARTING UP THE PRIUS, THE BRAKE FEELS HARD AND CAN'T BE DEPRESSED ALL THE WAY.  IF WE TRY TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE, THE BRAKES GRAB AND JERK THE CAR VIOLENTLY.

IN THE DISTANCE I SAW SOME CARS PUSHING THEIR BRAKE PEDALS SO I WANTED TO BRAKE AS WELL A LITTLE TO 1) DEACTIVATE THE CRUISE CONTROL, 2) REDUCE SPEED. PUSHING IT VERY GENTLY, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENED. THIS SCARED ME AND I PUSHED HARDER, THEN MY 2010 PRIUS STARTED BRAKING WAY MORE AGGRESSIVELY. I NOTICED ALONG THE WAY AND ALSO AFTER THIS THAT THIS BEHAVIOR IS CONSEQUENT. WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, I CANNOT USE THE BRAKE PEDAL TO RELEASE THE CRUISE CONTROL AND DIMINISH SPEED, BECAUSE NOTHING HAPPENS WHEN YOU PUSH THE BRAKE PEDAL GENTLY, IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME BEFORE IT REACTS. I FIND THIS DISTURBING, BECAUSE IN MY 2000 FORD CROWN VICTORY, EVEN THE VERY SLIGHTEST TOUCH ON THE BRAKE PEDAL ALREADY CAUSES THE CRUISE CONTROL TO TURN OFF AND VERY LIGHTLY DIMINISH SPEED. IN THE PRIUS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS I HAVE TO PRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL HARD, THEN AFTER SOME DELAY IT STARTS BRAKING FAST. IN THE BEGINNING I THOUGHT THIS IS NORMAL FOR THE PRIUS, BUT I FIND IT QUITE DISTURBING AND SOMETIMES SCARING. HENCE, I MUST TAKE WAY MORE DISTANCE TO CARS AHEAD OF MY ON THE HIGHWAY, BECAUSE I CANNOT BRAKE AS FAST AND STOP AS SOON AS THE OTHER CARS CAN. HONESTLY, IT IS VERY SCARY AND IT MAKES MY FEEL UNSAFE WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY WITH THE PRIUS. I AM DRIVING MY CROWN VICTORIA WHEN I AM DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY NOW A DAYS.  *TW *TR\",\n",

THE EXPERIENCE IS SUCH THAT THE BRAKES SEEM TO DISENGAGE AT THE TIME IN WHICH I HIT THE POTHOLE OR BUMP AND THE CAR LURCHES FORWARD FOR JUST A SPLIT SECOND.  TO ME IT FEELS LIKE GOING OVER AN ICE PATCH AND THE SENSATION IS SIMILAR TO HYDROPLANING AS WELL.

EVEN AFTER COUPLE OF WEEKS WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING, WHILE WE WERE STOPPED AT THE TRAFFIC LIGHT, THE CAR KEPT ROLLING FORWARD.

BRAKES ARE ALSO EXTREMELY SENSITIVE, ESPECIALLY AT LOW SPEEDS.  WHILE TRYING TO FEATHER THE BRAKES WHILE BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE (FOR INSTANCE) THE COMPUTER SEEMS TO TELL THE BRAKES TO FULLY CLAMP DOWN WITHOUT APPLYING ADDITIONAL FORCE TO THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THIS CAUSES A LURCHING MOTION AS OPPOSED TO A SMOOTH BACKUP AT IDLE SPEED.  ALSO, WHEN COMING TO A STOP, THE SLOWER YOU GO, THE MORE SENSITIVE THE BRAKING BECOMES SUCH THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO NOT OVER-APPLY THE ALREADY SENSITIVE BRAKES YOU INEVITABLY END UP STOMPING ON THEM AT THE LAST MINUTE BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF TRAVEL FROM ZERO TO FULL BRAKING IS MINISCULE.\\r\\nI HAVE OWNED ALL THREE GENERATIONS OF PRIUS.  THE FIRST HAD BRAKES THAT WERE UNUSUAL DUE TO THE REGENERATIVE SYSTEM, BUT THEY HAD ACCEPTABLE AMOUNT OF PEDAL TRAVEL AND WERE NOT A PROBLEM.  THE SECOND GENERATION'S BRAKES WERE MUCH IMPROVED OVER THE FIRST EDITION AND THEY FELT ALMOST LIKE NORMAL BRAKES.  BUT THIS THIRD GENERATION'S BRAKES ARE ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS!  I COMPLAINED ABOUT THEM TO THE DEALER ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND THEY SAID THEY WERE NORMAL AND THAT ALL PRIUS BRAKES WERE LIKE THAT.  THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT!

THE FIRST WAS WITHIN THE FIRST SIX WEEKS OF OWNING THE CAR.  I WAS SLOWING DOWN TO ENTER A GAS STATION AND THE CAR ACCELERATED.  I HAD BEEN APPLYING THE BRAKES ALREADY, BUT THE ACCELERATION TOOK ME BY SURPRISE.  I APPLIES THE BRAKES MORE FORCEFULLY AND THE CAR SLOWED.  THE SECOND TIME I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE DEALER FOR A GET TO KNOW YOU WITH THE MAINTENANCE DEPT.  I WAS DESCENDING A HILL WITH THE BRAKES BEING APPLIED.  AGAIN THE CAR SPED UP AND I BRAKED MORE FORCEFULLY AND IT SLOWED.  IT WAS SCARY. MY HUSBAND SAID THIS HAPPENED ONCE WHEN HE DROVE THE CAR, BUT HE DID NOT REMEMBER THE DETAILS.  WHEN WE TOLD THE DEALER, THEY SAID THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE 2010 PRIUS ACCELERATING OR BRAKING, BUT THAT THEY WOULD LOOK AT THE CAR.  OF COURSE, THIS HAPPENED THREE TIMES OVER THREE MONTHS.  THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. SOMEONE ELSE AT THE MEETING SUGGESTING ISSUES WITH THE PROGRAMMING, BUT WE WERE JUST MEETING WITH THE HEAD OF THE REPAIR DEPARTMENT.  THEY ONLY KNOW WHAT TOYOTA IS TELLING THEM.  NOW I SEE IN THE PAPER THAT TOYOTA CORRECTED THE ISSUE IN THEIR NEW PRIUS.  SO THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS AND DIDN'T TELL US.  THIS IS THE FIRST AND LAST TIME I WILL BUY A TOYOTA. *TR\",\n",

THIS DOES 2 THINGS, HELPS REGENERATE THE HYBRID BATTERY AND ASSISTS IN BRAKING THE VEHICLE, AND THE NORMAL BRAKES ALSO APPLY TO ASSIST IN BRAKING. I DID HAVE ANOTHER PRIUS OWNER ASK ABOUT THIS ALSO, I HAD HIM COME OUT AND DROVE WITH HIM AND COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE STATED CONDITION. I THINK HE WAS PUSHING TO FAST AND HARD ON THE BRAKE PEDAL CAUSING THE LURCH. WHEN I DROVE HIS VEHICLE I DID TELL HIM I WAS TRYING TO BE VERY CONSCIOUS OF HOW MUCH PRESSURE I WAS APPLYING TO THE PEDAL. I DID NOTICE THE BRAKES ARE VERY RESPONSIVE TO PEDAL PRESSURE. BEFORE RESPONDING TO YOUR E-MAIL I DID CHECK ONLINE WITH TOYOTA TECHNICAL GROUP TO SEE IF THEY HAD ANY PERTAINING SERVICE BULLETINS PERTAINING TO YOUR QUESTION, THERE WERE NO APPLICABLE BULLETINS.\\r\\n  I HOPE THIS HELPS ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHANKS FOR CHOOSING SEEGER TOYOTA,\\r\\nTIM EVERS, \\r\\nSERVICE MANAGER\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PROBLEM HAS CONTINUED AND I'VE NOTICED IT OCCURS WHEN BRAKING ON SNOW PACKED ROADS -- I NEARLY REAR-ENDED THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME WHEN MY CAR SEEMED TO LURCH FORWARD - I COULD NOT STOP - I HAD TO SWERVE INTO ANOTHER LANE TO AVOID COLLISION.  I REPORTED THIS PROBLEM TO ANOTHER TOYOTA DEALER (WEISS TOYOTA IN ST. LOUIS, MO.)  THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY RESPONSE.  WHEN I CONTACTED THE SERVICE MANAGER AGAIN ON 2/4/10, I WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD NOT HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT A PROBLEM WITH THE PRIUS FROM TOYOTA. *TR\\r\\n\",\n",

SINCE THE PURCHASE OF THIS CAR ON AUGUST 22, 2009, UNDER THE CASH FOR CLUNKERS PROGRAM, MY WIFE HAS REPEATEDLY DESCRIBED THE SITUATION IN WHICH THE BRAKES RELEASE UNEXPECTEDLY.  SPECIFICALLY, WHEN BRAKING AT LOW SPEEDS WHILE DRIVING OVER A RAIL CROSSING (SINGLE TRACK), THE BRAKES RELEASE MOMENTARILY AS THE CAR EXPERIENCES THE BUMPING MOTION INDUCED BY THE TRACKS.  THIS CAN BE REPLICATED AT WILL.  IN ADDITION, SHE HAS NOTICED A SIMILAR MOMENTARY RELEASE OF THE BRAKES WHEN APPROACHING A STOP SIGN ON A SLICK ROAD WHEN THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE MECHANISM WAS ENGAGED.  IN THESE FEW CASES, THE CAR ROLLED PAST THE STOP SIGN AND PARTIALLY INTO THE MAIN TRAVEL WAY.  NOTE THIS WAS NOT THE RESULT OF SLIDING ON SLICK PAVEMENT OR THE PULSE-RELEASE OF THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM BUT THE RELEASE OF BRAKES.  NONE OF THESE CASES RESULTED IN ANY PHYSICAL IMPACT OR PROPERTY DAMAGE--JUST THE DISCONCERTING FEELING THAT THE MOMENTARY LOSS OF BRAKING ENGENDERED.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWHEN MY WIFE FIRST NOTED THIS, I WENT TO HTTP://PRIUSCHAT.COM/, THE PRIUS OWNERS FORUM (WHICH I THINK IS SPONSORED BY TOYOTA).

I ESTIMATE THAT I AM DRIVING THROUGH THE POTHOLE AROUND 20-30 MILES AN HOUR. I DRIVE THIS WAY EVERY DAY FROM MY WORK TO HOUSE AND I AM ALWAYS BRAKING ON THIS STRETCH OF ROAD AS I TURN A CORNER RIGHT AFTER THE POTHOLE.

I HAVE EXPERIENCED (2) INSTANCES OF UNINTENDED ACCELERATION DURING THE TIME SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  I HAVE INFORMED DARCARS TOYOTA AND TOYOTA CORPORATION.  DARCARS RAN A \"HEALTH TEST\" ON FEBRUARY 4, 2009 ON MY VEHICLE AND THE TEST INDICATED EVERYTHING ON THE VEHICLE WAS OPERATING NORMALLY.  DARCARS THEN CONTACTED THEIR TOYOTA CALIFORNIA (TAC) AND RELATED MY PROBLEM TO THEM.  THE RESPONSE FROM TOYOTA WAS THAT MY EPISODES OF UNINTENDED ACCELERATION WAS JUST THE ABS SYSTEM ENGAGING NORMALLY.  THIS IS AFTER THE PRESS RELEASE FROM TOYOTA CORPORATION ON THE MORNING OF 02/04/10 ACKNOWLEDGING A PROBLEM EXISTING WITH THE 2010 PRIUS BUT CLAIMING TO HAVE ALREADY FIXED THE PROBLEM ON ALL NEW 2010 PRIUS AUTOMOBILES SOLD SINCE JANUARY 2010.  MY TWO QUESTIONS ARE 1) IF TOYOTA DISCOVERED A PROBLEM WITH THE 2010 PRIUS THAT THEY SUPPOSEDLY REPAIRED ON ALL 2010 PRIUS VEHICLES SOLD SINCE JANUARY, WHY HAS TOYOTA NOT CONTACTED ME ABOUT WHAT IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE? I HAVE OWNED AND BEEN DRIVING MY 2010 PRIUS SINCE SEPTEMBER \\'09. 2) WHAT IS THE SPECIFIC REPAIR THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY PERFORMED ON ALL 2010 PRIUS AUTOMOBILES SINCE JANUARY 1, 2010?  WHY DID MY TOYOTA SERVICE MANAGER HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH A REPAIR?  WAS THERE A SAFETY BULLETIN ISSUED BY TOYOTA?  WHY HAS TOYOTA NOT ALREADY AGREED TO REPAIR MY 2010 PRIUS (SOLD IN SEPTEMBER \\'09) WITH THE SAME REPAIR ALLEGEDLY ALREADY PERFORMED ON 2010 PRIUS AUTOMOBILES SOLD AFTER JANUARY 1, 2010?  *TR',\n",

MY CAR HAD ALMOST COME TO A COMPLETE STOP WHEN SUDDENLY THE ENGINE REVVED ON IT'S OWN AS MY FOOT WAS STILL ON THE BRAKE.  I HAD TO PRESS DOWN SO HARD ON THE BREAK TO KEEP IT FROM SURGING FORWARD THAT THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON AND THEN THE CAR'S REV WENT DOWN ON IT'S OWN AND ALL WAS BACK TO NORMAL AND HADN'T HAPPENED AGAIN SINCE.  I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY KEPT IT FOR TWO DAYS BUT DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT.  I HAVE TWO SMALL CHILDREN AND BOUGHT THIS CAR FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, SAFETY BEING ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ONES.  I AM NO LONGER FEELING SAFE.  THIS WAS NOT THE FLOOR MATS, OR A SUDDEN STOP MISTAKING ONE PEDAL FOR ANOTHER, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF DRIVER ERROR.  THIS WAS THE CAR!

ACCOMPANY THE HIGHER SPEED REVERSE, A HEAVY, ABRUPT BRAKING WITH A SLIGHT TOUCH OF THE BRAKE DURING THIS EVENT. THE BIG \"JERK\" (BRAKING) ROCK THE ENTIRE CAR AND BANGED  HEADS AGAIN THE HEADRESTS.THIS ONLY HAPPENED WITH ELECTRIC MODE AND MOST TIME WITH THE CAR PARKED A SLIGHT INCLINE. THIS UNINTENDED ACCELERATION SOMETIME HAPPEN A FEW TIME A DAY OR IT CAN GO TWO, THREE WEEKS WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM. THE DEALER CAN NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH MY CAR. AND TOYOTA HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER, IF YOU GO TO PRIUSCHAT FORUM UNDER GEN III 2010 PRIUS MAIN FORUM-BRAKING IN REVERSE, THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS IF A NEW DRIVER GET IN MY CAR AND NOT KNOW ABOUT IT.  THERE IS ONE POST IN PRIUSCHAT FORUM THAT BEST EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM: JUST YESTERDAY, MY PRIUS-III BACKED UP WITH SUDDEN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION, WITH MY FOOT ONLY ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.... I RECOGNIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE IT HAPPENED ONCE BEFORE, JUST OVER 2 MONTHS AGO. JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER I GOT THE CAR. WHEN I WAS BACKING OUT OF AN INCLINED DRIVEWAY...  I SUSPECT THAT SOME UNUSUAL ELEMENT OF THE TIMING OF TURNING THE CAR ON AND SHIFTING INTO REVERSE, AND POSSIBLY THE INTERNAL STATE OF THE COMPUTER AND THE HYBRID POWER SYSTEM COMBINE TO PRODUCE THIS \"ABRUPT\" REVERSE ACCELERATION AS I AM GENTLY EASING OFF MY FOOT PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL... THE ABRUPT BRAKING EFFECT DOES OCCUR, BUT ONLY IN RESPONSE TO THE MUCH MORE DANGEROUS \"UNEXPECTED, UNINTENDED\" REVERSE POWER (ACCELERATION), TO STOP THE CAR MOTION. NO MATTER HOW GENTLY THE BRAKE IS EASED FURTHER ON TO STOP, THE STOP IS \"ABRUPT\"  BY GARYGID ORANGE COUNTY, CA. I AM TRYING TO WORK WITH TOYOTA ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. *TR',\n",

ON THREE OCCASIONS, I HAVE EXPERIENCED A SITUATION WHERE THE BRAKES SUDDENLY RELEASED, AND I HAD TO SLAM ON THE BRAKE PEDAL TO PREVENT AN ACCIDENT.  TWO OF THE SITUATIONS HAPPENED WHEN I WAS COMING TO A STOP NEAR AN INTERSECTION (I WAS MOVING INTO A LEFT TURN LANE, AND SUDDENLY THE BRAKES RELEASED).  THE THIRD TIME WAS WHILE EXITING A FREEWAY, WHEN I HIT A POTHOLE, AND I FELT THE BRAKE RELEASE.  AFTER THE THIRD EXPERIENCE, I RECALLED THAT, PERHAPS, THE CAR RAN OVER A SMALL BUMP WHEN I WAS MOVING INTO THE LEFT TURN LANE, AND THAT MAY HAVE HELPED TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF THE BRAKE PEDAL.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE TOYOTA DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED IT, BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING WRONG.

EVERYTIME WHILE BRAKING IF THERE IS A BUMP OR ON EVEN A SLIGHT BIT OF ICE ON 1 WHEEL ONLY, THE BRAKES WILL RELEASE COMPLETELY AND GO BACK TO ACCELERATING RATHER THAN BRAKING. IT HAPPENS WHEN I EXIT THE HIGHWAY AND THERE IS A CHANGE IN SURFACES FROM TAR TO CONCRETE. IT HAPPENS VERY OFTEN AND CAN HAPPEN ANYTIME.  THIS OCCURS AT ANY SPEED FROM 10MPH UP AND I HAVE EXPERIENCED IT FROM 10MPH AND AS HIGH AS 55MPH.  THE PROBLEM FIRST OCCURRED AROUND 500 MILES ON THE CAR AND I NOW HAVE OVER 8500 MILES.  THIS STARTED IN AUGUST AROUND THE 15TH. I HAVE A 2007 HUMMER H3 AND I HAVE COMPARED THE BRAKING WITH THE SAME CONDITIONS AND SPEEDS AND THE PRIUS IS NOT RESPONDING CORRECTLY.  THE HUMMER BRAKES EVEN WITH THE CHANGES.  I HAVE ALSO COMPARED ON A 2006 VOLVO S60.  THESE BRAKES ARE FAILING AND IT WILL EVENTUALLY RESULT IN A CRASH OR A PEDESTRIAN BEING STRUCK.  THERE IS NO PULSING OF THE BREAKS THERE IS ONLY RELEASING FOR ICE OR FOR ANY SURFACE OTHER THAN PERFECT.  THERE SHOULD BE SOME TYPE OF REPAIR OR RECALL IMMEDIATELY.  I HAVE NOTICED THIS BUT THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY ME UNTIL I SAW THE MSNBC ARTICLE.  I WILL NOT LET MY WIFE DRIVE THIS CAR SINCE SHE IS PREGNANT.  IT IS NOT SAFE.  WHILE SITTING AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS THE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT KEEPS TURNING ON AND BLINKING AND WILL LOCK THE BRAKES UNTIL THE GAS PEDAL IS PRESSED.

I HIT THE BRAKES LIGHTLY, THE ABS ENGAGED (I COULD HEAR/FEEL THE BRAKES PULSE), BUT THE CAR DIDN'T SLOW DOWN MUCH.  I JAMMED ON THE BRAKES, THE ABS WAS STILL ENGAGED AND THE CAR FINALLY STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION, AGAIN SLOWING DOWN VERY SLOWLY.  IF IT HAD NOT BEEN A FOUR-WAY STOP, SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE HIT ME!  I KEPT DRIVING AND THE SAME THING KEPT HAPPENING TO ME:  I HIT THE BRAKES, THE ABS ENGAGED AND THE CAR STOPPED VERY SLOWLY.  IN SOME CASES, IT FELT LIKE THE CAR EVEN ACCELERATED A LITTLE BIT BEFORE FINALLY (AND SLOWLY) COMING TO A STOP.   I AM A MECHANICAL ENGINEER AND USED TO WORK FOR GENERAL MOTORS - I HAVE DRIVEN LOTS OF CARS - AND THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE.  I IMMEDIATELY DROVE HOME AND DROVE MY 2002 HONDA CIVIC (WHICH DOES NOT HAVE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES) DOWN THE SAME ROAD.  WHILE THE CAR DID SLIDE IN THE SNOW, IT STOPPED IN ABOUT ONE-THIRD THE DISTANCE OF MY PRIUS.

FOR THE LAST 13 YEARS, I HAVE DRIVEN ONLY TOYOTA'S ., BUT HAVE BECOME DISILLUSIONED WITH THIS CAR. THE ROAD NOISE IS EXCESSIVE AND THE MPG SHOWN ON THE DISPLAY SHOWS 2-3 MPG MORE THAN ACTUAL MPG. IF I COULD TRADE THIS CAR IN FOR NEAR THE AMOUNT I PAID FOR IT. I WOULD DO IT TOMORROW. THOUGH IT IS ONLY MY OPINION,  I FEEL THAT THE QUALITY OF TOYOTA PRODUCTS HAS DECREASED DRAMATICALLY DURING RECENT YEARS. THIS IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF RECALLS DURING RECENT YEARS. *TR\",\n",

       "  'Summary': \"THERE APPEARS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES ON MY 2010 PRIUS.  THERE IS A SUDDEN LOSS OF BRAKING FORCE IF I APPLY THE BRAKES WHILE ROLLING OVER UNEVEN PAVEMENT.  WHEN IT FIRST OCCURRED, IT WAS ON SNOW.  ONCE I SAILED INTO THE INTERSECTION.  THE SECOND TIME, I ALMOST REAR ENDED THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  I WENT HOME AND THEN DROVE MY WIFE'S ACURA IN THE SAME SNOWY CONDITIONS AT THE SAME INTERSECTIONS AND DIDN'T EXPERIENCE ANY PROBLEMS.  I KNOW THE PROBLEM WASN'T DUE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS.  I HAVE SINCE THEN BEEN ABLE TO REPRODUCE IT IN DRY CONDITIONS.  THE COMMON CONDITION IS BRAKING OVER UNEVEN SURFACES.\\r\\n\\r\\nSOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT IT FEELS LIKE SUDDEN SURGE OF ACCELERATION.  THE GASOLINE ENGINE ISN'T (USUALLY) ON WHILE THE CAR IS BRAKING.  THE SURGE ISN'T DUE TO THE ELECTRIC MOTOR MALFUNCTIONING BECAUSE ON SMOOTH SURFACES, IT BEHAVES AS EXPECTED.  I BELIEVE WHAT THEY FEEL IS A LOSS OF BRAKING POWER WHICH MAKES THE CAR FEEL LIKE IT IS ACCELERATING.  SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THIS IS NORMAL ABS BEHAVIOR.  I'VE OWNED SEVERAL CARS WITH ABS AND THIS IS NOT THE SAME NOR WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER 'NORMAL' BEHAVIOR.  IT COULD BE A COMBINATION OF THE UNEVEN SURFACE WITH ABS, REGENERATIVE BRAKES, FRICTION BRAKES, SUSPENSION SPRING RATE AND TIRES.  WHILE NORMAL ABS WILL EXHIBIT LESS BRAKING FORCE AND LONGER DISTANCES TO STOP WHEN IT IS ENGAGED, IT ISN'T THE SAME AS THIS CONDITION.  OR AT LEAST IT SHOULDN'T BE THIS TOUCHY TO ENGAGE.  WHEN IT HAPPENS, IT IS RATHER ALARMING.\\r\\n\\r\\nI REALLY LIKE THIS CAR.  I THINK IT IS A GREAT PIECE OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY.  HOWEVER THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.  I CAN'T ACCEPT IT BEING A NORMAL QUIRK OF THE CAR.  I TRAVEL WITH MY WIFE AND YOUNG KIDS IN THIS CAR.

ON 2 OTHER OCCASIONS, NEAR MY HOME APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION IN WHICH I NEEDED TO SLOW DOWN, THE CAR JUMPED WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES.  THE PAVEMENT WAS IN 2 SECTIONS (SPLIT HORIZONTALLY), ONE PART CONCRETE AND THE ADJOINING SECTION ASPHALT.  THE CAR SLIPPED/JUMPED FORWARD WHILE BRAKING.  THE 5TH OCCASION OCCURRED APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION AND THE CAR LURCHED FORWARD AS I TRIED TO STOP ALMOST HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. THIS WAS ON DRY PAVEMENT, DON'T KNOW THE REASON.  GOING OVER POTHOLES ON AT LEAST 1 OCCASION,THE SAME REACTION. \\r\\nHAD MENTIONED TO THE DEALERSHIP SEVERAL TIMES, THE FIRST TIME BEING AT A NEW OWNER ORIENTATION MEETING.  THEY WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS ISSUE.  WAS ADVISED IF IT KEEPS OCCURRING, TO BRING THE CAR IN FOR AN INSPECTION.   I NOW HAVE AN INSPECTION SCHEDULED FOR FRIDAY FEB 5TH AT THE DEALERSHIP. *TR\",\n",

EACH TIME, I WAS EASY TO MEDIUM BRAKING AND HIT A BUMP OR WAS ON ROUGH SURFACE.  THE BRAKES JUST APPEAR TO FAIL.  NATURAL REACTION IS TO PRESS HARDER ON BRAKE PEDAL.  USUALLY BY THIS REACTION TIME THE BRAKES ARE BACK AND YOU STOP ABRUPTLY OR SKID TO A STOP.  IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH ROUGH ROADS OR BUMPS THAT HAPPEN AT A GIVEN POINT DURING BRAKING. VERY SCARY SITUATION.  THIS HAS HAPPENED ON BOTH DRY PAVEMENT AND SNOW PACKED ROADS.  AGAIN, THE COMMON FACTOR IS THE \"BUMP\" DURING BRAKING. EACH TIME I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE VEHICLE AND THE VEHICLE HAD NO ADDITIONAL REAR WEIGHT.  SPEED WAS UNDER 25-30 MPH. *TR',\n",

I HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN 10 TIMES SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR IN OCT OF 09.  IN THE FIRST MONTH THE DEALER TOLD ME THEY HAD NOT HEARD OF THIS. TWO MONTHS AGO (DEC)A MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE ELECTRIC ENGINE KICKS IN (WHEN REGENATIVE BREAKING) WHICH DRIVES THE FRONT WHEELS FOR A SMOOTHER BREAKING, SO HE SURMISED THAT IF THE BREAKING WHEELS ARE NOT MAKING CONTACT THE CAR WOULD SPEED UP.  ON 1/13/2010 I MET WITH THE HEAD OF SERVICE FOR THE DEALERSHIP.  HE TOLD ME THAT THE DEALERSHIP TESTED A PRIUS HOOKING IT UP TO A COMPUTER AND REPRODUCED THE ENVIRONMENT OF THIS COMPLAINT. ALTHOUGH HE ADMITTED THERE WAS A MOMENTARY LACK OF BREAKING WITH THE LOSS OF BACK WHEEL CONTACT WITH THE PAVEMENT HE CLAIMED THERE WAS NO ACCELERATION NOTED.  HE ALSO ADMITTED THE TEST WAS DONE AT APPROX. 25MPH.  I SUGGESTED HE SHOULD REPEAT THE TEST AT 40-50MPH AS THIS IS WHERE IT IS MOST NOTABLE.  TOYOTA'S ONLY SUGGESTION IS TO DRIVE CAREFULLY.  THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM BUT THIS IS THERE SOLUTION.  I HAVE BEEN CAREFUL BUT ON 1/31/10 I WAS DRIVING AT 45MPH BEGINNING TO DECELERATE AS THE LIGHT AHEAD HAD TURNED RED, AND THE TRUCK INFRONT OF ME HAD TO PANIC STOP AS A CAR CUT INFRONT OF HIM, AT THAT MOMENT MY REAR LEFT WHEEL HIT A POTHOLE SO I WAS NOT ABLE TO BRAKE AND ACTUALLY ACCELERATED TOWARD THE BACK OF THIS TRUCK.  WHEN THE BRAKES REENGAGED I ACTUALLY STOPPED 12 INCHES FROM HIS BUMPER.

SO FAR, THIS ISSUE ONLY OCCURS AT VERY SLOW SPEEDS, SUCH AS WHEN BACKING OUT OF THE GARAGE OR WHEN BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPACES.  ON OCCASION, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM IN THE FORWARD DIRECTION WHEN STOPPING IN THE SLOW CONDITIONS OF A PARKING LOT.  FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE BRAKING ACTION:\\r\\n1. I START THE CAR (POWER BUTTON WITH FOOT ON THE BRAKE).\\r\\n2. I PLACE THE SHIFT LEVER IN REVERSE OR DRIVE WITH FOOT ON THE BRAKE.\\r\\n3. I RELEASE THE BRAKE PEDAL.\\r\\n4. THE CAR EASES BACKWARD (OR FORWARD, AS THE CASE MAY BE).\\r\\n5. I APPLY THE BRAKE , EITHER TO SHIFT INTO DRIVE OR TO CHECK FOR TRAFFIC BEFORE CONTINUING.\\r\\n6. SEVERAL TIMES PER WEEK THE BRAKES LOCK THE INSTANT MY FOOT TOUCHES THE BRAKE PEDAL.\\r\\n7. WHEN THIS PROBLEM OCCURS, THE LOCKING ACTION WILL REPEAT EACH TIME I RELEASE THE BRAKE, EASE BACKWARD OR FORWARD, AND BRAKE AGAIN.\\r\\n8. THE BRAKE LOCKING IS SO INSTANTANEOUS THAT PASSENGERS\\' HEADS JERK AND THEY LOOK SURPRISED.\\r\\n9. THE BRAKING ACTION IS MORE LIKE THAT OF FLIPPING AN ELECTRICAL SWITCH THAN OF PRESSING A BRAKE PEDAL.\\r\\n10. FROM THE BEGINNING, I HAVE TRIED TO DETERMINE IF A CERTAIN SEQUENCE OF ACTIONS TRIGGERS THE LOCKING.  I CANNOT COME UP WITH ANYTHING.  SO FAR, THE ONLY CONSTANT IS THAT THIS LOCKING HAPPENS WITH THE FIRST STOPS AFTER STARTING THE CAR.  I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED IT WITH SUBSEQUENT STOPS.  HOWEVER, HEAVEN HELP US IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR AT HIGHER SPEEDS!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAT THE 5000 MILE SERVICE, I ASKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE.  THE SERVICE REP SAID THAT SOME PRIUS OWNERS HAD MENTIONED THAT THEIR BRAKES \"GRABBED\" ONCE IN A WHILE.  THE REP SAID THAT IT COULD BE A \"WET BRAKE\" ISSUE. *TR\\r\\n',\n",

SHE REPORTED THAT THE BRAKES SEEMED TO LOCK (NOT THE NORMAL ABS FEEL) AND SHE LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR, WHICH THEN SLID/SKIDDED INTO A CURB WHICH PUNCTURED THE FRONT PASSENGER TIRE.

IT FEELS AS IF I HAVE HIT A PATCH OF GLARE ICE WITH ALL FOUR WHEELS.

THE BRAKE PEDAL HAS NEARLY NO \"PLAY\" OR \"FEEL\" TO IT, CAUSING THE CAR TO JERK TO A STOP WHEN THE SLIGHTEST PRESSURE IS APPLIED.

WHEN IT HAPPENS, I\\'M IN THE PROCESS OF BRAKING, AND THERE\\'S A \"PUSH\", ALMOST LIKE THE BRAKES DIDN\\'T \"TAKE\", FOLLOWED BY A LOSS OF STEERING FOR A SECOND OR TWO.  IT\\'S ALSO HAPPENED TO MY HUSBAND ONE TIME.  THERE DOESN\\'T SEEM TO BE ANY RHYME OR REASON AS TO WHEN IT HAPPENS (WET ROAD VS. DRY ROAD, TURNING OR GOING STRAIGHT, FLAT OR HILL).  I ORIGINALLY ASSOCIATED THE PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES BECAUSE I ALSO HAVE THE \"SLIDING\" ICON COME ON  THE DASHBOARD WHEN I\\'M COMPLETELY STOPPED AND LEAN FORWARD IN MY SEATBELT.  HOWEVER, I\\'M NOW WONDERING IF IT\\'S NOT THE BRAKES, BUT THE TRANSMISSION, SINCE IT SORT OF FEELS LIKE IT\\'S NOT DOWNSHIFTING WHEN IT\\'S SUPPOSED TO, OR IT SHIFTS BACK INTO A HIGHER GEAR FOR A SECOND WHILE BRAKING.  I CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION AFTER WAITING IN THE CAR WHILE IT WAS RUNNING.  WITH THE CAR ON, EMERGENCY BRAKE ON, BUT NOT IN PARK, THERE WAS A DEFINITE \"JOLT\" WHEN THE GAS ENGINE WOULD TURN ON AND THEN OFF AGAIN A FEW MINUTES LATER.  ALTHOUGH THERE HASN\\'T BEEN A CRASH YET, THERE WERE TWO TIMES WHEN IT CAME REALLY CLOSE TO THAT, AS I WAS TURNING AND ALMOST HIT THE CARS ON THE SIDE STREET THAT WERE IN THE LEFT TURN LANE WAITING TO TURN ONTO THE STREET I HAD BEEN TRAVELING ON. *TR',\n",

THIS OCCURRED WHILE I APPLIED THE BRAKES. I WENT OVER A BUMP OR POTHOLE. IT SEEMED LIKE THE CAR ACTUALLY ACCELERATED MOMENTARILY AND I HAD TO  KEEP APPLYING THE BRAKES TO THE FLOOR AND HOPED THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH DISTANCE TO STOP. I REMEMBER GOING DOWN A HILL, APPLYING THE BRAKES  AND THE CAR WAS SLOWING DOWN, THEN I WENT OVER THE BUMP OR POTHOLE IN THE ROAD AND THE CAR TOOK OFF LIKE I WAS ACCELERATING. I FELT LIKE I HAD LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE FOR AT LEAST 2 SECONDS OR 20FEET  BUT FORTUNATELY NO OTHER VEHICLES WERE NEAR BY. I NOW MAKE SURE THAT I BRAKE SOONER, AND ALLOW MORE FOLLOWING DISTANCE. ESPECIALLY IN BAD WEATHER. ANTI-LOCK BRAKES SEEM TO HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE PROBLEMS IN THAT THE WHEELS DON'T LOCK BUT  THOSE ON THE PRIUS SEEM A BIT MORE NOTICEABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE ELECTRIC AND THE PADS DON'T SLOW THE CAR LIKE NORMAL BRAKES. (AT LEAST THAT WHAT MY SALESMAN TOLD ME.) HE SAID THAT THE PADS WILL LAST OVER 200,000 MILES. HOPEFULLY I'LL BE ABLE TO DRIVE IT THAT LONG WITHOUT AN INCIDENT.

JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I DEFINITELY NOTICED THIS ISSUE IN MY NEW PRIUS.  APPROXIMATELY ONCE A MONTH, WHEN I'M BRAKING OVER AN UNEVEN OR SLIPPERY SURFACE, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE CAR GOING OVER THE SLIPPERY SURFACE, WHILE I'M BRAKING, THERE IS A MOMENT LASTING LESS THAN A SECOND WHERE IT FEELS LIKE THE BRAKES DISENGAGE.  (CAUSES YOUR HEART TO SKIP A BEAT WHEN IT HAPPENS.)\\r\\n\\r\\nI ALSO NOTICED A SEPARATE QUIRK THE OTHER DAY THAT I WANT TO PASS ON TO YOU.  I'M NOT SURE IF THIS WAS DONE DELIBERATELY BY TOYOTA OR WHETHER THIS IS A DEFECT, HOWEVER, I BELIEVE MY SPEEDOMETER IS CALIBRATED SO THAT IT READS A SPEED THAT IS 2 MPH FASTER THAN MY ACTUAL SPEED.  I NOTICED THIS WHEN I WENT ON A TRIP AND USED MY WIFE'S TOM TOM, WHICH USES ITS GPS SIGNAL TO MEASURE THE SPEED OF THE CAR.  THE TOM TOM IS USUALLY SPOT ON IN MY WIFE'S ACURA.  IN THE PRIUS, IT WAS INDICATING THAT MY TRUE SPEED WAS 2 MPH LESS THAN WHAT MY SPEEDOMETER INDICATED.  I'M WONDERING IF THIS WASN'T SOMEHOW INTENTIONALLY DONE BY TOYOTA TO GET BETTER PERCEIVED GAS MILEAGE BY THE DRIVER.  HAVING THE CAR GET OVER THE 50 MPG THRESHOLD IS A BIG MARKETING ADVANTAGE FOR THEM.  GETTING OVER THIS THRESHOLD WOULD BE EASIER IF THE ACTUAL SPEED OF THE CAR WAS LESS THAN THE PERCEIVED SPEED.  *TW\",\n",

BOTH OF US HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF \"LOSING CONTROL\" OF THE CAR WHILE BRAKING ON ICY ROADS.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMY FIRST EXPERIENCE HAPPENED DURING OUR FIRST BIG SNOW FALL.  I WAS APPROACHING THE ENTRANCE RAMP TO AN EXPRESS WAY AND HAD TO APPLY THE BREAKS WHEN A CAR INFRONT OF ME BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN AND SLIDE TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RAMP.  AS I APPLIED THE BREAKS, THE CAR BEGAN A SERIES OF QUICK FORWARD JERKS ASSOCIATED WITH KNOCKING SOUNDS.   I ALSO HEARD A SLIGHT CHANGE IN HOW THE ENGINE SOUNDED.  FORTUNATELY, I ESCAPED A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT SINCE MY PRIUS DRIFTED TO THE RIGHT BEFORE CONTROL WAS REESTABLISHED.   IT WAS FRIGHTENING.   \\r\\n\\r\\nTHIS IS THE FIRST CAR I HAVE OWNED THAT HAS AN ANTI LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM.

EACH TIME WHEN YOU SLIGHTLY DEPRESS THE BRAKES, THE CAR SLAMS TO A COMPLETE STOP.   WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO CORRECT IT, HAS BEEN TO TURN OFF THE CAR COMPLETELY AND RE-START THE CAR.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIT MAY JUST BE COINCIDENCE, BUT TYPICALLY THE BRAKES RETURN TO COMPLETELY NORMAL OPERATIONS IN REVERSE AFTER THE IGNITION HAS BEEN SHUT OFF AND THE VEHICLE ENGINE RESTARTED.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GREATEST ODDITY IS THAT IT APPEARS THAT THE BRAKES DO NOT RESPOND IN THE SAME DEGREE AS THE BRAKES ARE DEPRESSED.

ON BOTH OCCASIONS, I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK AND WENT OVER A SPOT ON THE ROAD WHICH, BECAUSE IT WAS DARK, I COULDN¿T SEE FOR SURE, BUT WHICH FELT LIKE A POT HOLE.  (I ALSO THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN RAINING ON BOTH OF THESE OCCASIONS, ALTHOUGH I CAN¿T RECALL FOR SURE).  IMMEDIATELY AFTER HITTING WHAT I THINK WAS A POT HOLE, I FELT THE CAR SUDDENLY AND DRAMATICALLY ACCELERATE.  BOTH TIMES I APPLIED THE BRAKES AND THE CAR STOPPED ACCELERATING.  AT THE TIME, IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME WHAT WAS GOING ON.  BUT, NOW THINKING ABOUT IT, I THINK IT LIKELY THAT THE SUDDEN JOLT TO THE CAR, PERHAPS COMBINED WITH MOISTURE, CAUSED SOME TYPE OF ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTION, WHICH THANKFULLY, WAS SHORT-LIVED (OR AT LEAST STOPPED BY BRAKING).  SHORTLY AFTER THESE INCIDENTS, I MENTIONED THEM TO MY WIFE.  SHE REPORTED THAT SHE HAD EXPERIENCED VERY MUCH THE SAME THING ON A SEPARATE (I.E., A THIRD OCCASION) DRIVING OUR PRIUS.  *CN',\n",

TRYING TO SLOW DOWN BECAUSE THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME IS STOPPING, OR BECAUSE I AM APPROACHING A STOP SIGN OR RED LIGHT, OR BECAUSE I AM TURNING OR GOING INTO A CURVE).  SO FAR, THIS BRAKE FAILURE HAS NOT CAUSED AN ACCIDENT BUT IT HAS CAUSED ME TO COME VERY CLOSE TO HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME ON ONE OCCASION. I HAVE COME TO NO LONGER FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY PRIUS BECAUSE I CANNOT TRUST THE BRAKES WHEN THERE ARE BUMPS OR POTHOLES IN THE ROAD.\\r\\n3. I BROUGHT MY PRIUS TO THE SERVICE CENTER OF THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR. I BROUGHT THE CAR IN ON 2/4/2010. THAT EVENING WHEN I SPOKE TO THE MECHANIC, HE TOLD ME THAT THE BRAKES ARE NORMAL AND THAT HE DID NOT DO ANYTHING TO FIX MY CAR AND THAT I COULD PICK MY CAR UP. I THEN SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER AND TOLD HIM THAT I DID NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE CAR UNTIL THEY FIXED THE BRAKING PROBLEM. MY CAR IS STILL AT THE DEALERSHIP AND HAS NOT BEEN FIXED BECAUSE THEY ARE REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE BRAKES ARE NOT FUNCTIONING SAFELY. *TR',\n",

AT THAT POINT I DECIDED NOT TO TURN AND CONTINUED CAREFULLY DOWN THE HILL.  FORTUNATELY THERE WERE NO VEHICLES IN FRONT OF ME OR I FELT I MIGHT HAVE SLID INTO THEM.  LATER THAT WEEK I CALLED AND TALKED TO THE TOYOTA SERVICE MANAGER WHERE I HAD BOUGHT THE CAR.  HE SAID HE WASN'T AWARE OF ANY PROBLEM WITH BRAKES, THAT HE HAD A PRIUS, ALTHOUGH AN OLDER MODEL, AND HADN'T HAD ANY PROBLEM.  HE HAD HEARD FROM ONE OTHER PERSON WITH A BRAKING COMPLAINT ON THE 2010 MODEL.  I ASKED HIM TO INFORM ME IF HE FOUND OUT ANYTHING BUT I NEVER HEARD FROM HIM.  THE CONDITION WAS SERIOUS ENOUGH FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THAT SINCE I HAVE A SECOND CAR I HAVE NOT USED THE PRIUS IN INCLEMENT WEATHER.

THE END RESULT IS THAT INSTEAD OF IMMEDIATELY STOPPING, THE CAR ENDS UP SLIDING FOR ABOUT A SECOND BEFORE STOPPING, WHICH COULD OBVIOUSLY LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT GIVEN THE EXTRA DISTANCE THE CAR IS TRAVELING INSTEAD OF BRAKING IMMEDIATELY.  AFTER THIS HAPPENED REPEATEDLY ON A STREET NEAR MY HOME IN SAN FRANCISCO, I TOOK THE CAR TO THE TOYOTA DEALER FROM WHICH I BOUGHT IT ON NOVEMBER 24, 2009 (CITY TOYOTA IN DALY CITY).  AFTER EVALUATING THE CAR OVERNIGHT, THEY GAVE ME A WRITTEN REPORT (A COPY OF WHICH I\\'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE) AND TOLD ME THAT IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE ANTILOCK BRAKES BUT SAID IT WAS A \"NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC OF [THE] VEHICLE.\"  NOTE THAT WHILE THEY WERE LOOKING AT MY PRIUS, THEY GAVE ME ANOTHER LOANER 2010 PRIUS (MODEL III) AND THAT CAR HAD THE EXACT SAME ISSUE (ALSO NOTED ON THEIR WRITTEN REPORT).  \\r\\n\\r\\nAFTER LISTENING TO THE NEWS AND SEEING AN ARTICLE THIS MORNING WHERE TOYOTA ADMITTED THERE WERE BRAKING ISSUES WITH 2010 PRIUS CARS MADE BEFORE JANUARY 2010, I BECAME EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF MY CAR AND POTENTIAL FOR AN ACCIDENT.

ON SUNDAY, JANUARY 31, 2010 I WAS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD APPROACHING A \"T\" INTERSECTION AT A STOP SIGN. THE MAIN ROADS HAD BEEN CLEARED OF ICE BUT THERE WAS SOME ICE REMAINING ON OUR STREET. I WAS TRAVELING VERY SLOWLY, PUT ON MY BRAKES AND NOTHING HAPPENED. THEN I TRIED PUMPING THE BRAKES SINCE I GOT NO RESPONSE OTHERWISE. I SLID THROUGH THE STOP SIGN, TRIED TO TURN MY TIRES TO THE LEFT TO AVOID THE CURB AND ENDED UP JUMPING THE CURB WITH BOTH FRONT TIRES. ON INSPECTION WHEN I GOT HOME (4 HOUSES DOWN FROM THE INCIDENT) I NOTICED THE RIM OF THE RIGHT TIRE HAD BEEN CRACKED AND THE TIRE HAD SOME DAMAGE. I HAD TO WORK ON MON & TUES AND DID NOT DRIVE THE CAR ON THOSE DAYS. YESTERDAY, 02/03/10 I TOOK THE CAR TO HIBDON TIRES (2 BLOCKS AWAY) SINCE THE DEALERSHIP IS OVER 30 MILES AWAY AND I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE IT ON THE HIGHWAY. THEY PUT ON THE SPARE TIRE AND DETERMINED THAT THE PASSENGER RIM WAS NOT REPAIRABLE, THE DRIVER RIM WAS INTACT AND BOTH TIRES WERE INTACT AND REUSABLE. THEY INDICATED THE AXLE DID NOT APPEAR DAMAGED. I ORDERED ANOTHER TOYOTA RIM TO MATCH ($411.20) AND WITH AN ALIGNMENT ($65.00) I WAS QUOTED A TOTAL PRICE OF $512.26. \\r\\n\\r\\n     I CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALER TODAY (02/05/10) AFTER READING THE MEDIA REPORTS ABOUT COMPLAINTS BY OTHER PRIUS OWNERS DESCRIBING  THE VERY SITUATION THAT HAPPENED TO ME.

ALSO, WHEN BACKING THE BRAKES WILL GRAB REPEATEDLY MAKING VEHICLE JERK - AND MAKES DRIVER LOOK LIKE WE CANNOT DRIVE.  SEE 'PRIUS CHAT' SITE FOR MANY OTHER LIKE INCIDENTS BY OTHER DRIVERS AND SPECULATIVE SOLUTIONS.  THIS ALSO HAPPENS WHEN PULLING FORWARD FROM PARKING AND HIT BRAKES IN ORDER TO MAKE A 3-POINT TURN (EXAMPLE) ETC.  THIS HAPPENED THE VERY FIRST TIME I GOT INTO THE CAR WITH THE SALESMAN SITTING BESIDE ME, AND HE REMARKED WHAT GOOD BRAKES THEY WERE.  I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AN ANNOYING TRAIT OF THE CAR (BEING A HYBRID)  UNTIL THE INTERSECTION INCIDENT LAST WEEK - AND THE NEW BRAKE NEWS ON THE PRIUS.  THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS PART OF THE DEFECT BEFORE A PILE-UP COLLISION IS CAUSED.  IT ALMOST SEEMS AS IF THERE IS NO 'POWER' TO THE BRAKES IN A 'GLIDING' TYPE MODE. *TR\",\n",

I WAS TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 12 MPH AND THE ROADS WERE DRY.  I WAS NOT TAIL GATING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME WAS CUT OFF AND HE IMMEDIATELY HIT HIS BRAKES.  I DID THE SAME.  MY CAR BEGAN TO BUCK AND JUMP AND I HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME CAUSING OVER $10,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE TO MY 2010 TOYOTA PRIUS.  MY CAR WAS TOWED AND REPAIRED BY TOYOTA OF DALLAS.  I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE DEALERSHIP AS WELL AS TO STATE FARM.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS TOLD ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES IN MY VEHICLE.  THEY CLAIM I MUST HAVE BEEN TRAVELING TOO FAST OR TOO CLOSE TO THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME.  I WAS NOT ISSUED A CITATION BY THE SHERIFF.  MY AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY AS I WAS TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 12 MPH.  I CONTINUED TO COMPLAIN TO TOYOTA ABOUT THE BRAKES AND THEY SENT AN ENGINEER TO EXAMINE MY VEHICLE ON TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 2 WHO AGAIN TOLD ME THAT THERE WERE NO ISSUES WITH MY BRAKES.  THE VERY NEXT DAY, THE NTSB BEGAN AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE BRAKES, AND THIS MORNING, FEBRUARY 4 (2 DAYS AFTER THE ENGINEER INSPECTED MY VEHICLE) TOYOTA ANNOUNCES THAT THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE BRAKING SYSTEM IN MY VEHICLE.\\r\\nI CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME ISSUES WITH MY BRAKES.

THE BRAKES ENGAGE FOR A SECOND, AND THEN WE EXPERIENCE NO BRAKING AT ALL FOR NUMBER OF SECONDS.  WE TOOK OUR PRIUS INTO JON LANCASTER TOYOTA IN MADISON, WI WHERE WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND TOLD THE MECHANIC OF THE BRAKING ISSUES WE WERE EXPERIENCING .

MY HUSBAND PUMPED THE BRAKES FOUR TIMES AND EACH TIME THIS DELAY IN BRAKING OCCURRED.  THERE WAS NO BRAKING HAPPENING AT ALL.  THE CAR WAS SLOWING DOWN FASTER WHEN THE BRAKES WERE NOT APPLIED, THAN WHEN THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED.  THERE WAS FRESH SNOW ON THE ROAD.  THERE WAS A DANE COUNTY SHERIFF AT THE INTERSECTION AND MY HUSBAND AND THE PERSON HE HIT RAN THE INCIDENT BY THE STATE PATROL WHO AGREED THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR THE TWO PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT TO EXCHANGE INSURANCE AND CONTACT INFORMATION AND LEAVE THE SCENE WITHOUT CALLING THE LOCAL POLICE.

WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, I CANNOT USE THE BRAKE PEDAL TO RELEASE THE CRUISE CONTROL AND DIMINISH SPEED, BECAUSE NOTHING HAPPENS WHEN YOU PUSH THE BRAKE PEDAL GENTLY, IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME BEFORE IT REACTS. I FIND THIS DISTURBING, BECAUSE IN MY 2000 FORD CROWN VICTORY, EVEN THE VERY SLIGHTEST TOUCH ON THE BRAKE PEDAL ALREADY CAUSES THE CRUISE CONTROL TO TURN OFF AND VERY LIGHTLY DIMINISH SPEED. IN THE PRIUS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS I HAVE TO PRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL HARD, THEN AFTER SOME DELAY IT STARTS BRAKING FAST. IN THE BEGINNING I THOUGHT THIS IS NORMAL FOR THE PRIUS, BUT I FIND IT QUITE DISTURBING AND SOMETIMES SCARING. HENCE, I MUST TAKE WAY MORE DISTANCE TO CARS AHEAD OF MY ON THE HIGHWAY, BECAUSE I CANNOT BRAKE AS FAST AND STOP AS SOON AS THE OTHER CARS CAN.

I WANT TO REPORT ISSUES WITH SUDDEN ACCELERATION EVEN WHEN I AM STEPPING ON THE BRAKE.  I NOTICED EVERY TIME I PASS THRU UNEVEN ROAD, FOR EXAMPLE POTHOLES, ICY ROADS, SNOW.  THE MOST COMMON ISSUE I HAVE IS AS I AM GOING DOWN THE ROAD AND CAR HITS A POTHOLE OR MANHOLE (THOSE WITH METAL COVERS) THE CAR WILL SUDDENLY ACCELERATE, ALTHOUGH I AM STEPPING ON THE BRAKE.  SOMETIMES I AM AFRAID I WILL HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME, ESPECIALLY WHEN IM IN TRAFFIC.  EVEN GOING AT 5-15 MPH, THE CAR WILL ACCELERATE WHEN IT HITS UNEVEN ROAD LIKE POT HOLES OR ICY ROADS.  THIS HAS HAPPEN QUITE A FEW TIMES SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  JUST YESTERDAY, WE HAD ABOUT 1-2 INCHES OF SNOW.  I WAS DRIVING SLOW AND WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN, THE CAR HIT SOME UNEVEN ROAD AND SNOW AND ACCELERATED WHEN I WAS STEPPING ON THE BRAKE TO MAKE THE TURN.  THE CAR WENT UP THE SIDEWALK AND THE BUMPER CRACKED AS IT HIT THE CONCRETE EDGE THAT SEPARATES THE ROAD AND THE SIDEWALK.  NO ONE WAS HURT AND NO PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS DONE.  THE CAR IS WORKING FINE, BUT THIS SUDDEN ACCELERATION ISSUE IS A MAJOR CONCERN, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT I READ AND HEAR IN THE NEWS THAT 2010 TOYOTA PRIUS ARE BEING REPORTED WITH COMPLAINTS OF SUDDEN ACCELERATION.  I THOUGHT MY ISSUE WAS AN ISOLATED CASE.  PLEASE TAKE THIS COMPLAINT INTO ACCOUNT.  I WILL BE GOING TO THE DEALERSHIP THIS WEEKEND FOR THE 15K SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE AND WILL REPORT THE ISSUE TO THEM. *TR',\n",

THE PROBLEM IS SHORT, UNEXPECTED BURSTS OF ACCELERATION AT LOWER SPEEDS, ESPECIALLY AS THE CAR IS SLOWING DOWN, WITH OR WITHOUT BRAKING. I BELIEVE IT OCCURS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ENGINE SHIFTS FROM HYBRID TO ALL ELECTRIC. FOR EXAMPLE, ON A CURVING EXIT RAMP OFF A ROAD, AS THE CAR SLOWS, AND AS BRAKING AND ACCELERATION ARE RELEASED, AND THE CAR SHIFTS INTO PROPELLING ITSELF ON ELECTRIC, THERE IS A BURST OF ACCELERATION AT SOME TIME IN THIS MANEUVER.

BRAKES ARE ALSO EXTREMELY SENSITIVE, ESPECIALLY AT LOW SPEEDS.  WHILE TRYING TO FEATHER THE BRAKES WHILE BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE (FOR INSTANCE) THE COMPUTER SEEMS TO TELL THE BRAKES TO FULLY CLAMP DOWN WITHOUT APPLYING ADDITIONAL FORCE TO THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THIS CAUSES A LURCHING MOTION AS OPPOSED TO A SMOOTH BACKUP AT IDLE SPEED.  ALSO, WHEN COMING TO A STOP, THE SLOWER YOU GO, THE MORE SENSITIVE THE BRAKING BECOMES SUCH THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO NOT OVER-APPLY THE ALREADY SENSITIVE BRAKES YOU INEVITABLY END UP STOMPING ON THEM AT THE LAST MINUTE BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF TRAVEL FROM ZERO TO FULL BRAKING IS MINISCULE.\\r\\nI HAVE OWNED ALL THREE GENERATIONS OF PRIUS.  THE FIRST HAD BRAKES THAT WERE UNUSUAL DUE TO THE REGENERATIVE SYSTEM, BUT THEY HAD ACCEPTABLE AMOUNT OF PEDAL TRAVEL AND WERE NOT A PROBLEM.  THE SECOND GENERATION'S BRAKES WERE MUCH IMPROVED OVER THE FIRST EDITION AND THEY FELT ALMOST LIKE NORMAL BRAKES.  BUT THIS THIRD GENERATION'S BRAKES ARE ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS!

THE SECOND TIME I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE DEALER FOR A GET TO KNOW YOU WITH THE MAINTENANCE DEPT.  I WAS DESCENDING A HILL WITH THE BRAKES BEING APPLIED.  AGAIN THE CAR SPED UP AND I BRAKED MORE FORCEFULLY AND IT SLOWED.  IT WAS SCARY. MY HUSBAND SAID THIS HAPPENED ONCE WHEN HE DROVE THE CAR, BUT HE DID NOT REMEMBER THE DETAILS.  WHEN WE TOLD THE DEALER, THEY SAID THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE 2010 PRIUS ACCELERATING OR BRAKING, BUT THAT THEY WOULD LOOK AT THE CAR.  OF COURSE, THIS HAPPENED THREE TIMES OVER THREE MONTHS.  THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. SOMEONE ELSE AT THE MEETING SUGGESTING ISSUES WITH THE PROGRAMMING, BUT WE WERE JUST MEETING WITH THE HEAD OF THE REPAIR DEPARTMENT.  THEY ONLY KNOW WHAT TOYOTA IS TELLING THEM.  NOW I SEE IN THE PAPER THAT TOYOTA CORRECTED THE ISSUE IN THEIR NEW PRIUS.  SO THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS AND DIDN'T TELL US.  THIS IS THE FIRST AND LAST TIME I WILL BUY A TOYOTA. *TR\",\n",

THE BRAKE DISENGAGEMENT ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT ON MONDAY THIS WEEK ON E STREET AS THE CAR HIT AN ICE PATCH AND THE BRAKE DISENGAGED MOMENTARILY.

WHEN THIS OCCURS, I AM NOT CERTAIN THAT THE CAR WILL STOP.  THIS DOES NOT OCCUR DURING BREAKING ON SMOOTH SURFACES.  I REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO THE TOYOTA DEALER IN NOV. AND RECEIVED THIS RESPONSE:  WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 04, 2009 1:05 PM:   I'M RESPONDING TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE PRIUS BRAKING CONDITION. ONE THING TO KNOW ABOUT THE PRIUS BRAKING SYSTEM IS THAT WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED THERE IS A SIGNAL TO THE GENERATOR TO ENGAGE. THIS DOES 2 THINGS, HELPS REGENERATE THE HYBRID BATTERY AND ASSISTS IN BRAKING THE VEHICLE, AND THE NORMAL BRAKES ALSO APPLY TO ASSIST IN BRAKING. I DID HAVE ANOTHER PRIUS OWNER ASK ABOUT THIS ALSO, I HAD HIM COME OUT AND DROVE WITH HIM AND COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE STATED CONDITION. I THINK HE WAS PUSHING TO FAST AND HARD ON THE BRAKE PEDAL CAUSING THE LURCH. WHEN I DROVE HIS VEHICLE I DID TELL HIM I WAS TRYING TO BE VERY CONSCIOUS OF HOW MUCH PRESSURE I WAS APPLYING TO THE PEDAL. I DID NOTICE THE BRAKES ARE VERY RESPONSIVE TO PEDAL PRESSURE. BEFORE RESPONDING TO YOUR E-MAIL I DID CHECK ONLINE WITH TOYOTA TECHNICAL GROUP TO SEE IF THEY HAD ANY PERTAINING SERVICE BULLETINS PERTAINING TO YOUR QUESTION, THERE WERE NO APPLICABLE BULLETINS.\\r\\n  I HOPE THIS HELPS ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHANKS FOR CHOOSING SEEGER TOYOTA,\\r\\nTIM EVERS, \\r\\nSERVICE MANAGER\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PROBLEM HAS CONTINUED AND I'VE NOTICED IT OCCURS WHEN BRAKING ON SNOW PACKED ROADS -- I NEARLY REAR-ENDED THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME WHEN MY CAR SEEMED TO LURCH FORWARD - I COULD NOT STOP - I HAD TO SWERVE INTO ANOTHER LANE TO AVOID COLLISION.  I REPORTED THIS PROBLEM TO ANOTHER TOYOTA DEALER (WEISS TOYOTA IN ST. LOUIS, MO.)  THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY RESPONSE.

I HAD NEVER BEFORE DRIVEN A PRIUS, SO I FIGURED THAT WAS HOW THE CAR RAN.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS?  THE DEALER SAYS THEY'LL CHECK THE BRAKES - BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.  ALSO - MY CAR INSURANCE RATES WILL GO UP BECAUSE OF THIS ACCIDENT, AND IT COST ME THE $500 DEDUCTIBLE.  I'M DISGUSTED, TO SAY THE LEAST.  I THOUGHT I'D BOUGHT THE HOLY GRAIL OF DESIGN EXCELLENCE & FUEL ECONOMY -- NEW AND IMPROVED 3D-GENERATION.   I BOUGHT AN EXPENSIVE HEADACHE. *TR\",\n",

SINCE THE PURCHASE OF THIS CAR ON AUGUST 22, 2009, UNDER THE CASH FOR CLUNKERS PROGRAM, MY WIFE HAS REPEATEDLY DESCRIBED THE SITUATION IN WHICH THE BRAKES RELEASE UNEXPECTEDLY.  SPECIFICALLY, WHEN BRAKING AT LOW SPEEDS WHILE DRIVING OVER A RAIL CROSSING (SINGLE TRACK), THE BRAKES RELEASE MOMENTARILY AS THE CAR EXPERIENCES THE BUMPING MOTION INDUCED BY THE TRACKS.  THIS CAN BE REPLICATED AT WILL.  IN ADDITION, SHE HAS NOTICED A SIMILAR MOMENTARY RELEASE OF THE BRAKES WHEN APPROACHING A STOP SIGN ON A SLICK ROAD WHEN THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE MECHANISM WAS ENGAGED.  IN THESE FEW CASES, THE CAR ROLLED PAST THE STOP SIGN AND PARTIALLY INTO THE MAIN TRAVEL WAY.  NOTE THIS WAS NOT THE RESULT OF SLIDING ON SLICK PAVEMENT OR THE PULSE-RELEASE OF THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM BUT THE RELEASE OF BRAKES.  NONE OF THESE CASES RESULTED IN ANY PHYSICAL IMPACT OR PROPERTY DAMAGE--JUST THE DISCONCERTING FEELING THAT THE MOMENTARY LOSS OF BRAKING ENGENDERED.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWHEN MY WIFE FIRST NOTED THIS, I WENT TO HTTP://PRIUSCHAT.COM/, THE PRIUS OWNERS FORUM (WHICH I THINK IS SPONSORED BY TOYOTA).

I HAVE EXPERIENCED (2) INSTANCES OF UNINTENDED ACCELERATION DURING THE TIME SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  I HAVE INFORMED DARCARS TOYOTA AND TOYOTA CORPORATION.  DARCARS RAN A \"HEALTH TEST\" ON FEBRUARY 4, 2009 ON MY VEHICLE AND THE TEST INDICATED EVERYTHING ON THE VEHICLE WAS OPERATING NORMALLY.  DARCARS THEN CONTACTED THEIR TOYOTA CALIFORNIA (TAC) AND RELATED MY PROBLEM TO THEM.  THE RESPONSE FROM TOYOTA WAS THAT MY EPISODES OF UNINTENDED ACCELERATION WAS JUST THE ABS SYSTEM ENGAGING NORMALLY.  THIS IS AFTER THE PRESS RELEASE FROM TOYOTA CORPORATION ON THE MORNING OF 02/04/10 ACKNOWLEDGING A PROBLEM EXISTING WITH THE 2010 PRIUS BUT CLAIMING TO HAVE ALREADY FIXED THE PROBLEM ON ALL NEW 2010 PRIUS AUTOMOBILES SOLD SINCE JANUARY 2010.  MY TWO QUESTIONS ARE 1) IF TOYOTA DISCOVERED A PROBLEM WITH THE 2010 PRIUS THAT THEY SUPPOSEDLY REPAIRED ON ALL 2010 PRIUS VEHICLES SOLD SINCE JANUARY, WHY HAS TOYOTA NOT CONTACTED ME ABOUT WHAT IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE? I HAVE OWNED AND BEEN DRIVING MY 2010 PRIUS SINCE SEPTEMBER \\'09. 2) WHAT IS THE SPECIFIC REPAIR THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY PERFORMED ON ALL 2010 PRIUS AUTOMOBILES SINCE JANUARY 1, 2010?  WHY DID MY TOYOTA SERVICE MANAGER HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH A REPAIR?  WAS THERE A SAFETY BULLETIN ISSUED BY TOYOTA?
